Understandably so of course, but Marr is definitely a yard or so off the pace these days #indyref

polls are polls and results will be results. waiting and watching how the #indyref will turn out

The votes are cast, and now we wait.  Will the United Kingdom remain united? #IndyRef

Love to know what thinks of Peter Kellner's polls and statement of certitude. #indyref

Even Curtice is nicking my Sunderland tweet now;)#indyref

Going to sleep, and let's hope it'll be a resounding no in Scotland's #indyref when I wake up tomorrow.

Lots of discussion about what the outcome of this referendum might mean for Scotland. But what will it mean for referendums?? #indyref

Grassroots are *sinister* to wee twee #indyref fuckers who want to keep us politically inactiveThey think it is THEIR game, not ours

In Numbers: How many tweets have been sent about the referendum? #IndyRef

Of course #newsnight is talking about the West Lothian Question saves em talking about and to the people in Geroge Square  #indyref

Still 0-0 on Sky News. Good game though. #indyref

This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands. #IndyRef
