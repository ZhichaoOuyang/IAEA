Superbowl Patriots vs Giants.

Madonna will be a guest performer on the halftime show.

They'll start building Madonna's stage in exactly 2 minutes

That's rough to tear your ACL in the #SuperBowl but not as rough as your tactless team releasing you the day before.

Game is kinda weak this year. Commercials are even worse. #superbowl

Dr Seuss The Lorax Super Bowl Trailer   #superbowl

Am I the only one who's praying that Madonna doesn't bust out that purple leotard again #SuperBowl

MADONNA's getting ready to go LIVE! #SuperBowl #MadonnaSuperbowl

One thing the #Superbowl proves is how crappy the American film industry has become.

I am really over talking babies #madonnabowl #superbowl

As soon as #madonna comes on, i'm going to go get more #redbull for my #vodka #NFL #Superbowl

Patriots take 10-9 lead with longest super bowl drive in history. #NFL #superbowl

the amount of time Brady had to throw was unreal! #SuperBowl

have the new pussycat dolls been revealed !? #SuperBowl

If you're gonna spend P&A money on a #Superbowl commercial you better make GOOD on it #MARVEL #AVENGERS!!!!!

#Madonna is getting ready to show how it's done. #SuperBowl

Score at the half: 3. That's how many Dr. Peppers I've had. #SuperBowl

RT They are all running towards the approval of their fathers. #superbowl

Millions may go far in buying airtime during the #SuperBowl but they don't go very far in creativity and talent. :)

Why all the gratuitous violence in media, America? #superbowl

They're adding a ramp for #Madonna right now #SuperBowl

Didn't watch one minute of #SuperBowl but I'm tuning in to halftime show.

NFL waiting for Madonna's halftime performance to advertise next year's Betty White Revue. #SuperBowl

I was gonna dance at halftime no matter what the score was #madonna #patriots #superbowl

Whoever brought back the GI Joe movie franchise and got the Rock and Bruce Willis involved should be shot. #SuperBowl

YES!!! IT'S ABOUT TIME MADONNA!!! #SuperBowl NEXT!!!

Hoping lights go out in stadium & Schneider shows up to fix them. #SuperBowl #OneDayataTime

Is she singing in her American or Cockney accent tonight?#Madonna #superbowl #shes86youknow

Well, my toddler is really digging #Madonna's #HalfTime show at least. #SuperBowl #Giants #Patriots

Lad on the in the #Superbowl looks EXACTLY like someone I know, ahahaha

Man, they gotta stop letting senior citizens perform the halftime show. #superbowl #madonna

This would never happen at a football match half time in England.  #SuperBowl

LMFAOOO  I don't think the half-time entertainer should ever be older than the #Superbowl itself. S

Watching Madonna. The thigh high boots cover scars from her hip replacement.  #lateshowwriters #superbowl

(this is how you stay slightly less relevant, madonna) #superbowl

its like botox was given life and dancing boots #superbowl

But #Madonna is rocking it. Certainly most spectacular #SuperBowl show ever.

If someone did this on America's Got Talent, they'd be laughed (and buzzed) off stage. Truly diabolical. #Superbowl  Ahaaa

I wonder if the energy translates more in person from Madonna's performance than via the boob tube. Seems a little restrained #SuperBowl

The staging, though simple, is incredible. The stadium makes for an amazing backdrop. #SuperbOwl #HalfTime

Well, seems #Madonna knows how to make an exit too. #SuperBowl

So Madonna showed her Depends on national tv & the Internet? That's HOT! #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow

Kristin: Is that Gene Simmons? NoRussell Simmons? Me: Neither. Are you thinking of Richard Simmons? #superbowl #thatdudeonthetightrope

Clint Eastwood just told you! #SuperBowl

What's up with all these depressing #Superbowl commercials?

Madonna had an HBCU band, Black cheerleaders, Mississippi Mass Choir, Cee-Lo, LMFAO & Nicki Minaj! #SuperBowl aint NEVER been this BLACK!

i couldn't wait for you to in her big XFactor #SuperBowl commercial! i know you all were watchin

I know! Let's send Rebecca Black! #SuperBowl

Yes, Madonna's vocals were pre-recorded. Of course. But so were Whitney's and y'all didn't say shit. #superbowl

I'd like to see #TomBrady in the same kind of commercial as David Beckham. #superbowl

Come on, Giants. Shut them down! #superbowl

Wait is that Vernon Davis? Oh, it's one of The Giants. I miss Vernon:( #yardage #superbowl

Oops! Got caught up in watching the #StellarAwards on UPN & missed the #SuperBowl halftime show. Did I miss anything good?

My favorite part was seeing #Madonna shufflin, tbh #SuperBowl And her actually singing #OpenYourHeart

The city with first Public Library is disputed. Sidis claims the first public library was Boston's in 1636 #chevygametime #superbowl

I liked Madonna. She rocked it! #superbowl

Is it wrong that I sometimes want to have sex with all of you? The feeling is fleeting & a bit private butreal none-the-less. #SuperBowl

Hey Canadians! See the ads you wanted to watch, but couldn't  #SuperBowl

New England defense bringing a little hat on the drive. #SuperBowl

She KILLED IT! LOVED. Did you enjoy #Madonna's #HalfTime show performance?  Share your #SuperBowl XLVI thoughts

#SuperBowl halftime show = EPIC sets, lightingyou guys killed it! Congrats! #buycanadian

I already forgot the first time I saw you Fiat. I already forgot. Don't remind me of J-Lo. #Superbowl #BrandBowl

madonna lip synced so bad they dropped her into hell. the end. #superbowl #halftime

And pepsi max burns Coke Zero.  Good one #superbowl

There's no use in using #Superbowl cause u can't read anything it

Let there be love in the world of soft drinks guys, especially if the world's going to come to an end soon! #SuperBowl

sorry, had to make/eat dinner. did I miss anything? #brandbowl #superbowl

FACT: #Chevy has officially reached the negative reach / over-frequency bar in their tax-dollar bought #Superbowl pelting

I'm glad to see Jay Leno able to pick up a little extra cash a few times tonight. I'm sure he's feeling the pinch like everyone. #SuperBowl

I'm not going to lie. I missed the half time show. #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Drinking Game: Baby! Drink up!

Marcus Bachmann is still doing that Madonna dance routine back home in Minnesota. #SuperBowl

Tom Brady just took a hard shot, landing on his left shoulder. #SuperBowl

There is no question that #Madonna is still one of the most prolific performers of our time. #superbowl

Yeah, I remember hanging out with Warhol in the 70s and drinking Buds at Studio 54. #SuperBowl

Looks like #Patriots gone go home wit that crown crown #Superbowl

VIDEO: Duncan Keith, and others discuss the #Blackhawks problems after practice on #SuperBowl Sunday

33 yd FG by Tynes good.  Patriots 17, Giants 15, :35 left 3rd Quarter.  #superbowl

Your SuperBowl Sideline Twitter Seat.  //t.co/QRMyZdlE

Oh boy here we go crunch time c'mon giants!!!!! #BigBluePride #NYG #SuperBowl #gottabelieve

Another big break for the Giants there. Recover Bradshaw fumble. #SuperBowl

Tom Brady's hail Mary was intercepted because he's not Tim Tebow. #SuperBowl

Yo if your on twitter  #SuperBowl hating. STFUUUUUU LOL just dont watch the game or log off! Fvck off my TL tho lol

I have faith in the NY Giants. They will win this #Superbowl - Just don't ask me the score. --   // overtime would be cool.

#superbowl that's a good point. Hmm Like a wall.

Nice to see a #superbowl commercial with the message 'help rescue dogs.' kudos to

I loved the Michael Phelps subway  commercial. He eats 12,000 calories per day. Rescue dogs for Budlight was great too.#Superbowl

I feel for you #Giants fans. You hate to see these injuries pile up for them.  #SuperBowl #SB46 #SBXLVI #Giants #Patriots #NFL

*fist bump* Thank you so much! #superbowl

First down by #TomBrady #superbowl KEEP EM COMING!

What I'm having for dinner. It's no #sexualchocolate but very refreshing. #superbowl

WOW.  Wes Welker drops what would have been a TD pass.   #SuperBowl

This is about to get interesting. do we have another perfect set-up for a #giants comeback?   Probably.  #superbowl

In US #SuperBowl more important at the moment wait a sec k?

Glass #superbowl is typical of the luxury tableware used by wealthy Romans  #score!

Now that looked like Eli didn't want it that time, lol. #superbowl

Keep running why you keep stoppin ughhhh #SUPERBOWL

Yep, a presser by as competition to #SuperBowl . Her new Press Sec is a genious.

Watching other teams play football feels like I'm cheating on the #Saints. #SuperBowl #WhoDat
