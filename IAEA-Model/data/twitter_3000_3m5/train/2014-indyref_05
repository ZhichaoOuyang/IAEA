while your celebrating please remind yourself you have probably lost a lot of party support,  like me, forever. #indyref

Well done for building this live #indyref results map of #Scotland

I'm proud to have voted YES! Today's result is just a blip in Scotland's history, we are on a journey that ends with independence #indyref

The atmosphere is Glasgow city centre right now is terrible. Awkward silence from people who look utterly defeated. #indyref

Look's like some in Glasgow still haven't accepted the result #indyref

Glad that Scotland voted no in the #indyref the United Kingdom wouldn't be so great else

What a pathetic bunch of cowards, all over thr world people fight  die for independence but the Scotts won't even vote for it #indyref

Spiffing. So I can still eat a scotch egg without having to pay import tax? #indyref #ScotlandDecides #Scotland

Congratulations to sense - never again can we call it common #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Sad for #yesscotland friends. Hope you will get more autonomy from Westminster now in energy and welfare matters, at least. #indyref

#indyref Congratulations Scotland on a fine referendum and for injecting some much-needed passion into UK politics.

your assuming the #LabourParty won't change as a result of the #indyref - I think they must!!!

My Asian half has just declared a referendum on independence from the tyranny of my genetic Caucasian rule. Ballots open today. #indyref

#indyref what, other than the enormous financial and political uncertainty, and tremendous cost and the need to move forward?

#indyref is over.. Time for the vote on whether to annex Alex Salmond for his egotistical romp that endangered our economy and well being

So, Boris Johnson will be Prime Minister of Scotland after all.. #indyref

I wonder how much damage #AlexSalmond has done to the #Scottish #Economy with businesses now having a cross border contingency.#indyref

We are calling for an urgent meeting of a Constitutional Convention -  to speed up the process of English devolution #indyref

the #indyref was just a glorified old firm game on social media.

Scotland! You stayed! It's your round now. GT for me! #indyref

It's all good Scotland, We still love you. Make up sex later? #indyref

Congratulations to all of Scotland for staying the UK #ScotlandDecides #indyref #Fife

Thanks for not leaving us Scotland. The scare will hopefully mean the gov will listen to Scotland/Wales a whole lot more now #indyref

The real victim in all this is David Cameron, who had to spend months thinking about things outside the south of England #indyref

Sick as a parrot Brian. #indyref On the bright side. I have ios8 and my phone hasn't exploded.

Thank heavens #Scotland decided not to vote for uncertainty #indyref #TheVow

Flag makers, flag designers and flag importers are cursing this morning's result.#BusinessAsNormal#ScotlandDecides#indyref #Gutted

9 of the 32 council areas voted more than 60% no in #indyref

If it's Yes, Cameron has promised to climb onto the roof of the Commons and toss himself off. #indyref

We also need to devolve more powers  across the UK.  #indyref Scotland isn't the only place that wants independence from London.

Glad to see that we're still the United Kingdom. It's time for some change though it's clear people want a say in how that happens #indyref

interviewing a 9 year old child about the #indyref  ?! Up next, an exclusive chat with my cat Monty #overkill #Scotland

in fact I don't believe the results. #indyref

Awwwww. Come here Scotland. Let's hug it out :( #indyref

It's hug a YES voter day today, after all, they're all just NO's in waiting #indyref

I'd rather be in a union that worked and was democratic than in an independent government that threatened my country's stability #indyref

Read LGA Chair's full statement responding to #indyref no vote today  #localgov

#indyref turnout shows low votes elsewhere not apathy. It's disillusionment with parties and low-quality candidates they offer us.

Although the result was disappointing #indyref campaign was amazing! Thanks to all you Yessers for making it a joy to be part of.

Morning all will be on from 10am discussing the result, link:  #indyref Tune in!

Many thanks all who did everything possible make change happen Sadly it was not to be. Here's to the future. #indyref

Instead the majority fear their vote will change nothing and doesn't bother. General election turnouts are pathetic compared to #indyref

Cameron can breathe a sigh of relief that he hasn't decapitated #GreatBritain. #IndyRef #NoVote

So frustrated with the #indyref that I forgot to iron one half of my shirt.

#indyref aside let's all just ignore westminster and build pre-figurative autonomy within the shell of the old - don't wait for permission!

Sad day for Scotland. Ironic that a country so divided has voted to stay united. #indyref

BBC News: Alex Salmond admits defeat in #IndyRef

Odd  that Cameron made no mention of his predecessor Gordon Brown whose efforts in saving the day for #bettertogether were gigantic #indyref

As if a 'no' vote didn't pish on the chips of #indyref campaigners, now the story's all about England. It doesn't rain, etc

Turned in at 1am once result was fairly clear, but good to see confirmed this morning. 55% for the UK - congrats #BetterTogether!#indyref

And 1 last thing before I go and do my weekly shop. Please stop talking about Scotland now. It's over. They are staying. End of. #indyref

Let's be clear comrades. This is a personal victory for #indyref

Well done Scotland. Logic and reason doesn't always prevail but thankfully this time it has #indyref

It's so disappointing that Scotland chose no you can't over yes we can at the #indyref lot of people around the world believed in Scotland.

Glasgow, Dundee, West Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire thank you! #indyref

No matter if you voted Yes or No you don't have a right to have ago at an opposite opinion #indyref #tolerance

Morning farming tweeps - what are your thoughts on the referendum result? #agrichatuk #indyref

Was #indyref all about the West Lothian question from the getgo??yes or no result meant labour loses the ability to form a majority Govt.

Now do we get a vote asking if we want to get rid of them? #indyref

Sad day in Scotland. More foodbanks, more benefit cuts and now more punishment to come from WM accompanied by broken promises #indyref

Kinda feels like a missed opportunity for Scotland. Think they're gonna look back on that vote with deep regret.#indyref #notsurprisedthough

We will learn from out mistakes and move on, but the fight for democracy, fairness and equality goes on. #indyref

#indyref name calling and accusations of vote rigging begin, if not careful scotland will tear itself apart

Highland, if anyone still cares, is about to declare. It's a slower pace of life up there, I'm told. #indyref

FTSE 100 up more than 40 points. RBS shares up more than 4% #indyref

What now for Scotland? Today's issue of The Stooshie (out today) looks at that very subject, and reflects on an incredible week. #indyref

William Wallace must be turning in his grave right now #indyref #voteyes you can lead sheep to water but you can't make them drink #scotland

Salmond and Sturgeon put on a brave face #indyref #no

You voted to become England's bitch.Well fucking done.#IndyRef #VoteYes #ScotDecides

Looks like #Shetland values the Union more than most Now why can that be? Stuffed by #Edinburgh? #SNP #Labour #IndyRef #bbcnews #skynews

Need to heal the rifts. It is now a case of #BetterDeliver #indyref  #whatnext

What a brilliant result to wake up to #indyref

At 4pm today I'm declaring Independence from the working week! #indyref

Yo, Highland ballot counters, you awake still?? #indyref

GOT spoiler: white walkers defeated by wildlings, with the help of the nights watch, and are now happy to stay north of the wall #indyref

Daaaaaave Cameron gives his first speech after #indyref #youremywifenow

agreed! STV have had a great #indyref

Battle lines emerging: English parliament v English regional devo. Which side will Ed  Nick join? #indyref

On the bright side, I predict Mary Pitcaithly for the next series of Celebrity Big Brother. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Scotland has decided: No to independence - Unite comment on the #indyref

Majority of Scots want stay united with our brothers and sisters in rest of UK. Relieved but anxious for our divided nation ;-| #indyref

Hold back the tears - it's the final #indyref declaration.HighlandTotal 165,976Turnout 87%Yes 78,069No 87,739

Whilst I'm getting bored of the #IndyRef coverage, at least it's keeping off the more boring coverage of queues outside Apple shops #iPhone6

HIGHLAND VOTES NO: And now all 32 councils have declared. #indyref

I see the Yes camp are at it already. 'It was no this time around' #indyref

Calls for greater devolution across rest of UK after Scotland result  #indyref

this result bad one for left in England as Cameron works to stop Scottish MPs voting on range of issues in Westminster #indyref

Scotland will get more tax raising powers - prepare for a low tax, low spend UK. #indyref  via

Congratulations Scotland, you've voted, you've decided! You've chosen your future. #Indyref #NatresSiSi

I think it's time for a federal United Kingdom #indyref

Think Scotland will be a different place for a while but we really should come together,to try and get the best deal possible! #indyref

Lets hope that the government devolve more powers to the other regions too. Why should Scotland get all the benefits? #indyref

C'mon Scotland, give us a hug. #indyref

Danny Alexander laughably says Barnett formula works well for the whole of UK but accepts there's a flaw in Wales. #indyref

As Scots reject Independence, Scotland will expect new promised powers to be honoured in rapid course   #indyref

#Destiny is one thing. #Timing is anotherthe #Scotland #indyref had a major drawback with the badly handled issue of the #currency.

Scots voted NO. Idi Amin's still the Last King of #Scotland . #indyref

Waking up to find Scotland has voted no to independence. Just hope it's for the best. I was really torn on this! #proudtobescottish #indyref

So it's a no then? The yes vote need to accept that people believe in the uk.  #indyref

Fair Isle jumpers all round today, right??? #Indyref #loveScotland

Right #scotland u had your chance now sit in the corner and don't say anything for a while okay good ! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

The campaign's over but long may the debate and appetite for change continue. A victory for a more United Kingdom rather than 'No'? #indyref

Also, farage salivating over this referendum and the pathetic response of Westminster #indyref

Quite confused by the way Brian Cox on talks about the Scottish people like they are a distant alien species #indyref

Say what you will about Salmond, but he was completely right about 1 thing: we're definitely keeping the pound. #indyref

Next stop: Federal Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ? #indyref

Final #indyref result: NO 2,001,926 (55%) YES 1,617,989 (45%). Turnout was 85%.

As usual providing the only common sense this morning. Time for a referendum on the #EU now!! #indyref #ukip #nigelfarage

The train to Scottish Utopia has been postponed indefinitely.  Time to choose a more realistic constitutional destination #indyref

#indyref england expects scotland to pull up its socks  deliver on all the potential it's boasting about #betterfuturetogether

Well #Scotland decided it's a #VoteNo to #scottishindependence! Here's to #DevoMax! Onwards and upwards #indyref

Phew. The weather map would have looked hideous. #indyref

Now, let's get on with tackling these bloody Tories.together. #indyref

So. #IndyRef is a NO. I'm glad, albeit somewhat bruised. Encouraged by promises of more power to England for English matters. Suspect a trap

So 2,001,926 voted No (55%) and 1,617,989 voted Yes (45%) with a turnout if 85% in the #indyref

Change? NO. M Scotland has rejected independence #indyref results confirm

Whichever way the #indyref vote went Alex Salmond was always going to be the winner with the Devo Max powers. David Cameron has been mugged.

Hard luck Scotland, good effort!! #independence #indyref #nottoday

Huge thanks to Scotland. Very proud to be a British citizen this morning. #indyref

We want an Proportional Representation English Parliament. Not a same0ld same0ld Westminster elite #LibLabCon closed shop.#indyref

HIghland declares No 53% Final total No 55% Yes 45% Turnout 85% #indyref

Final vote shows a 10% gap between Yes and No vote #indyref

Glad that's over tbh! Good result. #indyref

They should have a rerun of the #indyref, except this time, the question is asked solely to Susan Boyle who then nods or shakes head

Genuinely surprised at the #indyref result, really thought they would go for independence.

Gutted like most of Scotland this morning but guess we just have to go with the flow and get over it #OneScotland #indyref

Whatever your thoughts on the outcome of the vote, an 85% turnout is pretty damn impressive. #indyref

Hardly a landslide but I think it was an inevitable result in #indyref Time for politicians to wake up to the dissatisfaction across the UK

If a tree falls in the forest and there isn't a BBC journalist on hand to ask Nigel Farage his thoughts on it does it make a sound? #indyref

Unprecedented announcement by Cameron of huge and rapid constitutional changes. Politics is going to be very interesting. #indyref

#indyref #Scotland I'm not angry, not shocked just very disappointed. Now not the time for any further thoughts. #love philx

good morning Great Britain.. Delighted to still be with you #indyref #bettertogether

Toys are out the pram for Yes voters here #indyref

Scotland, whatever you voted, don't slip into apathy. We've got a Gen Election next year. Keep your spirits high and voices loud #indyref

Last vote in at last - by voting no Highland confirms comfortable No victory. This calls for champagne! #indyref is over.

What was the result last night, or are we still waiting?#IndyRef #ScotDecides

Final Result #bettertogether break 2,000,000 No's and 53% in Highland  #indyref

As much as I was hoping for it, the #no vote is a bit of an anti climax. Would've been funny to see what would've happened. #indyref

this will be how you begin to pay the price of a no vote in #indyref

My eye bags have their own luggage #indyref

Is there a German word on a par with 'Schadenfreude' to describe having your national identity squandered by cowardice? #indyref

Great to see an unmitigated triumph for democracy in the #IndyRef. The right result (IMO) and the subject matter engrossing a large turnout.

It's a #No vote, thank god for that, I don't have to change my duvet. #indyref #DevoMax

Go back to bed Scotland, your government is in control again. #fearoverhope #indyref

Ah' well, there goes my bus pass, free prescriptions and I better start saving for my future medical bills and council tax rises #indyref

Common sense prevails, let's get back to all being on the same side again #indyref  #needlessdivisions

Watching what's on TV. Oh wait. Hugh Henry and George Adam at the Renfrewshire Count #indyref

I wonder what concessions Scotland will get post #indyref? Whoever thinks the #euroref won't get the UK concessions is wrong

Yup, that'll do it BBC, let's see what the Royal Family think about the #indyref.  That'll make Scots feel better.

Final voters' turnout was at 85% an overall high for Scotland #ScotlandDecided #indyref

Nice to know people still have the capacity to care about something more than a reality celebrity show. #indyref

Scotland deserves more, starting now. Delighted they stayed but admire those who bravely voted for change. Fantastic turn out #indyref

Who will benefit most from this Scottish thing? UKIP or the Tories? This'll be incredibly interesting #Scotland #indyref

The most relieved man in UK politics this morning is probably Ed Miliband. #indyref

Democracy wins! Scotland we love you, I hope u are given more freedom  ur voice is still heard as a UK #united #indyref #DemocracyInAction

1/4 So here we are, #indyref result is there. Whether you supported Yes or No, this has been a great thing to happen. You've shown

Scotland has decided: No to independence  via #indyref

Sorry Yes voters but Scotland the brave?? Scotland the mouse more like it! #indyref #scotland

So the #indyref is over and immediately Nigel Farage is all over the media. Why????

Even with the intimidation from yes campaign they couldn't get enough votes., better luck next time oh wait there isnae a next time #indyref

David Cameron's statement in full after the #indyref (h/t to David Schneider)

So I guess it's a 'NO' for independence. #indyref

So pleased at #indyref result for all of Europe #bettertogether

So, business as usual this morning it seems #indyref

Barnet formula .. blah blah  devomax ..blah blah 46% voted for #socialjustice Shall we talk about that? #indyref

24 hour rolling news and yet Twitter had the result the day before. #TimeForSomethingNEW #indyref

Today is a very happy Friday. I never doubted the result.  Well done Scotland. United Kingdom You're fucking in !!! #IndyRef

I'll be shortly talking #indyref and trying to get you a full house if you're playing #barnettformulabingo

You better believe that #Westminster wont forget or forgive the resistance of the #Scots in the #indyref

So many political opinions on Twitter this morning! #lols #indyref

I've woken up back in Sixth Form Politics class: the West Lothian question to be settled? I feel young.. #indyref

#BBC correspondent Nicholas Witchell suggest some members of the Royal family urged the Queen to speak out in favour of the Union. #indyref

Wonder if 45% have managed to send a message? #indyref

The best Scottish Referendum Tweets (Part Three) #indyref

Final result of #Scotland's #Independence referendum #indyref NO (55%) YES (45%) Turnout 84.59%

So relieved when I woke up this morning to hear Scotland had voted no #indyref

That'll do. Bored of #indyref now. Let's go back to moaning about the weather.

Scotland the brave should never be sang again, we've just completely gone against what every word means in the lyrics #shitebags #indyref

Well, it was nice while it lasted. Still, we can now ALL hate the Tories #IndyRef #BetterTogether

Long night of #indyref = Increased caffeine intake

Scotland has decided, to those on the losing side accept it with good grace, the majority has decided #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Dundee, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire said Yes. So let them be independent? #indyref #Scotland

The Confidence and Power to have an #indyref in the first place, is what puts the Great in Great Britain. #LoveYouScotland

Right folks time to get the ball n chains back on,  fucking sell-out tory ukip supporting fucks I hope you die a slow death #indyref

family guy was good, but I still ended up watching till about 530 when the beeb decided it was a done thing #indyref

Oh my god Jeremy Vine is still on, somebody send him home!!!! He's still dancing with imaginary pink and green blocks #indyref

As a foreigner I wonder, would #indyref had happened at all if UK had proportional representation?

So, all the votes are in and Yes secured 37.7% of the Scottish electorate. Bit crap really. #indyref

Got to hand it to Mssrs Cameron and Milband. They made #indyref a competition when it shouldn't have been! Pair of utter buffoons

As disappointed as I am, we should use this opportunity to try and fix these problems the #IndyRef has highlighted for ourselves

A strategy that demonstrates better and compels both 'head' and 'heart' helps overcome 'choice' anxiety. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Lochaber some more, Sutherland some more, Lewis some  #indyref

84.5 per cent turnout - well, would you look at that! #indyref

So, Cameron and Farage have just turned devo-max into a 2015 electoral football. Labour (and Lib-Dems) may be in trouble. #indyref

Think that's something the police need to have a look at. #indyref #policescotland

Witchell speculates about Queen's view on the results in Scotchland.I do hope he goes on to tell us what Kate Middleton MAY think#indyref

A great result, but can't help but think that  Peter Kellner did more with 1 poll than the party leaders #indyref

twitter gag last night! Most people in Inverclyde missed the decision last night as they were Inverkip!! #indyref

On #indyref - see our #KeyFacts #infographic on the financialrelated professional services industry in #Scotland

Phew! Well done  The Union is safe in your hands!! #indyref

Just got msg 'want to help, inspired by turnout in Scotland' Join here:   #indyref

Lots more political fun to be had over the next couple of years , lets see what happens now in WM fight fight fight #indyref #scotland

Those of you that sent me nice messages today about #indyref are smashing. Cheers. All women too. I feel the love.

So the BBC are now stating 'more powers for London' after the #indyref urghmm hello of here in the rest of the country.

Whether Scotland voted yes or no, the SPL would still be be shit #indyref.

I've never been patriotic- but today I'm ashamed to call myself Scottish. #indyref #bittertogether

Scotland. Like a cheating partner looking over t'fence 2 see greener grass u have some making up to do. Come on, on your knees. #indyref

Kudos to for his YES pledge in the #indyref. No point in playing for so many Union Jack-arses.

Govt needs to clear decks for proper constitutional settlement for whole UK. They've set a stupid timetable but must honour it #indyref

is waking up to the fact that they have walked into a Tory trap. Say goodbye to rule in England for ever #indyref

I was hoping Cameron's feted EU referendum would bring some truth-telling to the EU debate in the UK.  #IndyRef has squashed that idea.

People who work in the UK make a profit from the English yet still slag us off What's that about? #indyref

Scotland4Union result now defines a new territory of constitution fix, devolution for all and of bolder UK presence in the EU #indyref

#indyref need to bear in mind nearly half of Scotland were willing to walk away from the Union.  Something is broken.

British people are being captured, threatened and murdered by terrorists and yet the #IndyRef seems to have more priority and importance.

Horay!!! It was a no victory. Now it's time for an English Parliament. #indyref

Scotland facing a time of huge transition What now for regions that voted yes? interesting to see if Cameron keeps his promises #indyref

8am the morning after Scottish #indyref, and from a Houses of Parliament IP someone is anonymously editing a Star Trek Wikipedia entry

These issues need to be decided via a UK General Election - a Westminster solution will need public assent #r4today #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref 'Tis a sad day for Scotland. You know what would make things better RBS  Standard Life PLEASE MOVE!

Really hoped I wouldn't have to use this pic #fighton #indyref #yes

England should now turn all angry girlfriend and not let Scotland in unless they promise not to do it again and buys flowers #indyref

Somewhere is kneeling over a toilet trying to get that haggis up. #IndyRef

Settled for a generation? Do you even know what words mean, Cameron? #indyref

It's like England just turned over in bed and Scotlands still there but their slowly taking their shoes off #indyref

Would have to be a muppet to vote Yes #indyref

So #Scotland has decided #No in the #Indyref triffic! Now can we focus on the more pressing matter of #GlobalPoverty Just a thought!

So Scotland asked England for a divorce, Scotland relented and both thinking how the marriage should proceed  #Indyref

Campaining against overwhelming media bias, corporate interest etc., and lost by less than 400k votes. Worth something I guess #indyref

A government that will happily watch children starve and disabled die and families evicted from their homes for pennies? #indyref

So my cheap and cheerful bunting lives to see another day #indyref #quintonwenchblog

The asteroid of Scottish independence has thankfully missed the United Kingdom #indyref

Whether pleased or not about the #indyref result, you have to admit an 85% turnout is great when only 65% voted in the general election.

Labour's sellout to business, implosion of the LibDems, Scotland's No to #IndyRef  London's dominance of all UKvictories for democracy?

Nasty, i know, but i hope they suffer personally. #indyref

I've got that feeling like when your football team loses a cup final, only difference is there won't be another chance next year! #indyref

Scotland votes No to Separation. Happy to be  involved #indyref  #ScotlandDecides #nothanks

Scotland should be made our servants now. It's what they want #indyref

YES! It's a NO! We are still a United Kingdom but it was close right? 44.5% still voted Yes! If you NO what I mean YES? #indyref

I think it was David Bowie wot won it #indyref

Why can't we get turnouts like that for a general election?  #indyref

.#Scotland could lead the world in creating jobs via green economy: look to #Denmark for ideas #indyref

When the Scottish Referendum result was known, the sigh of relief in Dowining Street must have been heard all over London. #indyref

Also, livid that we're still going to have to watch the SPL on Goals on Sunday!Shit on it! #indyref

In summary I'm disappointed for Scotland. I think everyone deserves better than the offal extruded into suits we call politicians. #indyref

Since the vote was no, keep your promise and piss off to America. Not that they want you there either #indyref

And of course, on this historic day, the leader of the 'UK' Independence Party is primarily concerned with England. Shocker. #indyref

Was going to write Scotland should be ashamed but that would be disrespectful to the hard working #Yes campaign who wanted change #Indyref

That's a lot of pinkgood work guys. #indyref

Nigel Farage says Scottish MPs should immediately give up right to debate on English issues at Westminster #indyref

Re-uniting Britain is about respecting the call for change of those who voted YES in #indyref but also remembering majority voted NO.

Well done Scotland 85% turnout is exceptional! Imagine if we got that at a general election! (re)-United and it feels so good #indyref

Regardless of being independent or not, we should be SO proud of our nation. We are so passionate and that showed this year. #indyref

I don't think I've heard any other news beyond #indyref since 0700

I only hope that IF the time comes, the UK will also say we're #BetterTogether in the #EU! #IndyRef is a taste of what could happen in 2017

I hadn't planned to listen to the #indyref results but an almighty thunderstorm made sure I had no choice. At least it was good news

HEADLINE OF THE DAY (he's still got it)  Och aye, it's the noo. #indyref

I'd like to thank David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne for securing this #No vote. Not. #indyref

As final declaration is made, can't believe how sad I feel. Just hope my kids and theirs never have cause to look back in anger.#indyref

So Scotland votes No, the Pound surges, FTSE opens high, everyones happy. Good PR stunt, whats next? #indyref

Not going to pretend I'm not disappointed by the result but at least it's over. Time now to make a change! #indyref

600 people ticked both boxes?! Now that's confused #indyref

smug comments like that are just so helpful #indyref

Can we track down the idiots that put an 'X' in both the Yes and No boxes? They're a danger to themselves. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Currently the power of fear can still overwhelm hope, we need to end corporate media propaganda starting with the bbc #indyref #bbcbias

Please  Video of Scotland Voter Fraud #indyref

Official result. 3,623,344 voted. Yes 1,617,989. No 2,001,926. Rejected ballots 3429. Turnout 84.6% #indyref #Scotland

Well, the turkeys voted for Christmas. Now,just wait for Westminster to pull the innards out.#indyref

so it was a No.. hope it now sparks change so that we can stand together as one Union and each country's voice can still be heard! #indyref

Ah, Scotland has been designated Lord Kelvin to work over whatever arrangements are to come.A Lord.Fuck off. #indyref

Final result: Yes 1,617989 No 2,001926 which represents 44.7% to 55.3% with a turnout 84.6% #indyref

Nice to wake up to a #NO vote in the Scottish #indyref no need to re - erect hadrians wall after all #phew

Number of the day: Confirmed final turnout in the Scottish independence referendum - a record! #IndyRef

No racing selections on at 8.30 as sports bulletin interrupted for final result in #indyref

I'm gonna have a scotch tonight. #indyref

Great to see Scotland stay in the union. We're all belong togeather. #indyref

Scotland and GB have proved we are democratic nations, says on how #indyref  answered a #qtwtain

Sit down Scotland, take a bow. The world is laughing at you. #scotland #embarrassment #indyref

Pleased at the #indyref resultand this despite Farage's best efforts.

anyone know who this #indyref vote counter is ?

Well well well, look who came crawling back #indyref

The biggest challenge answering the West Lothian question is which nation's MPs can hold specific cabinet positions #indyref

Now Britain needs to work together to provide togetherness, social justice and a hopeful future #indyref

BBC News seem to be picking the greyest places in Scotland for report backgrounds. #indyref

I made this to help my fellow Americans understand the  #ScotlandDecides #indyref,  what comes next, a bit better.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm gutted. #indyref

Amazing turnout  debate that's shaken up uk politics. I feel flat a/ result but let's have strength to go forward as #OneScotland #indyref

The Scottish referendum proves that a huge political and constitutional decision can be made without needing to resort to violence #indyref

So 691 people voted for both 'yes' and 'no' on the #indyref - not as if it was the most important vote you'll ever make!

think the Scottish yes voters would be all for it ;-) #indyref

Don't think you could get 86% in England, even at gunpoint. #indyref turnout was very impressive.

Mightily impressive turnout and campaign. Well played Scotland. #indyref

The thing is once you start talking about leaving you will eventually break up, just not this time around#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Claiming victory, conceding defeat - our #indyref live blog  How are you feeling now the votes are (almost) in?

On Morning Call from 9, what do you think of the Scottish referendum result? What will it mean for Wales? #indyref

Currently posting letters to Scottish MPs asking them not to vote on English only issues in Westminster #indyref

How can u burn the GB flag when u know all that it represents, embarrassing for Scotland #no #indyref

How to get 85% turnout? Ask a controversial yes/no question. #indyref

#indyref I accept the result. We lost. This time.

I guess this means Celtic and Rangers can keep trying to get admitted to the Premiership #indyref

HAHAHAHAHAH SHOVE THAT UP YOUR ARSE, SALMOND. #indyref

I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed  tells #triplejhack about #indyref. disagrees -It's a happy day for Scotland

Let's change together, it's not a divorce, it's a compromise, building a better Scotland isn't something we all agree on #Scotland #indyref

Cheap souvenir shops rejoice as they don't have to get rid of all their Union Jack equipment. They're the real winners here. #indyref

Over half a million difference in the yes or no vote I think it is a good thing that we didn't go independent from Scotland #IndyRef

#IndyRef Hey Scotties welcome back to the stuck-with-the-english club

From an English perspective, important for an answer to West Lothian question - English laws should only be voted on by English MPs #indyref

Yes voters. Please stop demonising No voters. People do what they think is right for many reasons. Let's move forward together. #IndyRef

'We'll give you more powers AND more cash than England'   #Indyref #UKIP #EnglandShafted

The banter when Cameron takes the promises back for more powers #indyref

Following 'no' vote in the #Scotland #indyref the #FTSE100 opens 61 points higher at 6880 approaching all time highs.

Listen up England! Over 84% of Scots voted in the #IndyRef !! Let's have a similar turnout for the General Election next year!!

Possible positive outcome for all of us with #indyref - Scottish Labour may be even more fucked than before. Here's hoping.

So, future of UK 'democracy' to be discussed behind closed doors by elite establishment led by unelected lord #indyref

hope when you play south of the boarder you get all the stick you deserve. Remember the Trinidad  Tobago shirt? #indyref

Now that the #indyref is over can we have some sexy pics of Scottish guys in kilts please, pref hairy and rugby type grrrr

ScotlandCurrently the post Chris Brown, Rhianna of the political world.  #indyref

2.6M scots voted in the #indyref what would 8.2M people living in London vote given the chance for independent self government #indylondon

Yes voters pretending to care about poverty/food banks. When was the last time you volunteered at Mary's meals or a food bank then? #indyref

Beautiful morning here in the UK. How are you all today? #indyref #YesScotland

To hit home the magnitude of that result, there's a food bank in Coatbridge on Sat and Sun. Lochs Street. Items appreciated. #indyref

Welcome back Scotland, welcome back to the British economic recovery and we can all carry on with it. Good news indeed. #indyref

Well the unemployed and ignorant #yes voters had their day. There is still hope for the rest #indyref

Glad we've still got Frankie Boyle. UK would have been a duller place without him #indyref

Cameron Pledges Overhaul of Parliament After Scots Vote  via #indyref

I'm proud to be Scottish.  Thank you Scotland for getting it right #indyref

Gutted for all the people living in poverty in Scotland. Indy was their only chance of change. Now it's back to the status quo #indyref

Regional devolution is more important than for England as a whole. #indyref can be the catalyst for a new form of UK federal government.

Looks like we won't be hearing the end of this anytime soon. I can see wars occurring! Gutted. #indyref #VoteYesScotland

The buzz will be over soon. Glad I got to experience this all #Scotland #indyref

Flying to London the day after the #indyref. Wondering what I'll see/hear

Has David Cameron resigned yet? Or is he going to carry on till the knives in his back finally bring him down? #Scotland #indyref

84.5% turnout for the Scottish #indyref - regardless of yes or no, that is a great result for democracy in itself

Well at least I haven't woken up having to Learn a tax system. #indyref #bettertogether

how lucky you all were, if #Scotland hd voted independent All your pillows will be fooked #solasttuesday #IndyRef

The other bright side to the Scottish No is that the Orkney and Shetland question now won't arise. That could have been messy. #indyref

We've ditched the William Wallis theme for vicars  tarts one! #onenation #indyref

Regardless of whether Scotland left or not, the UK hasn't existed since Ireland divided itself, imho. Great Britain is more apt! #indyref

I feel like i need to give Scotland a hug! #indyref come and cwtsh!

I think this probably swung it for #bettertogether in #indyref Gordon Brown demonstrated power of unity  solidarity

The area called Moray is pronounced Murray.  #indyref

#indyref and the UK government has shown others how to handle such matters. #thankyouwestminster

So now #indyref is finally over and we can go back to normal, yes? Genuinely don't know what the fuss was about, esp with this result! #hark

#indyref The world's press, diplomatic observers et al are packing, heading for the airport and shaking their heads in disbelief at Scotland

In honour of #indyref here's a little something from the Accidental archives on my soggy childhood hols in Scotland:

Disappointing news about the #indyref to wake up to. Impressed by quality of debate during campaign, could not see that happening in NI.

Well done democracy. Everyone did well on both sides. Mind u Huw Edwatds has put a shift in as well #indyref

Decision's made, can we hear about something different now?! #IndyRef

Basically, then, it's devo-max rather than independence-min. Both positions de facto the same, if not de jure. #indyref

Phew. Thank you, Scotland! Now for some radical decentralisation all round. #IndyRef

Coming up: a special 'Scotland Decides' programme. Scotland votes 'no' we have analysis and speak to in Edinburgh #indyref

i'm moving to some country that had the balls to declare independence. Like the USA or South Sudan #indyref #FuckYouAndYourEyebrowsDarling

So pleased with outcome of #indyref. Everyone move forward - settled for generation (not going to happen every year people) #bettertogether

Someone at  hit send too soon #woopsy #IndyRef

I would love to know more about the missing votes  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I'm surprisingly relieved by the #IndyRef result. We love you too Scotland! Thank u for staying :) 3

You don't know what you have until you face losing it.  Proud scot British citizen. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Disappointed is an understatement. A spree of bullets heads our way now, we'll suffer painfully more than we already r #indyref

Good grief, is still awake?! Excellent staying awake powers for #indyref coverage.

The howl of 'now we can punish the selfish, scrounging Scots' is awful. That verse isn't in 'God Save the Queen' anymore #indyref

Very pleased with the #indyref result. Hopefully it's set fear into Westminster and brings about some real positive constitutional changes.

Pleased that Scotland have agreed that we are better together. Time to be GREAT Britain again. Grazie Bonnie Scotland. #indyref

Wonder if the outcome would have been different if it was England voting on whether to keep Scotland part of the u.k. #indyref

Referendum: Scotland always gets the result it voted for!#indyref #scotland

Incredible enthusiasm of young people who had the opportunity to vote in #indyref - every reason to extend #votesat16 to all elections!

Cameron has said NI Institutions need to work effectively. Opposition? Less Departments? #indyref

See if the media and labour try and spin this as a victory for labour and a loss for SNP  Alex salmond. They are completely wrong! #Indyref

UK NEWS: Scotland votes no - despite Yes campaign winning majority in Glasgow  #indyref

Only a handful of people on my Facebook talking sense about the #indyref. No surprises there

#queenelizabeth #thequeen had no influence in the #indyref  If you believe that then you would believe anything #scotland

I think Scotland has just lost more investment instead of gaining. Countries will be scared to invest especially if UK leaves EU #indyref

So glad that I woke up to the brilliant news that Scotland will continue to be part of Britain #indyref

When are they announcing the real result? How many votes did 'Nicola Sturgeon loves the boaby' get?! #indyref

#indyref Scotland be proud heads held high is here show the world what a fantastic nation we are

Oh thats made me so happy, the bloody Queens relieved. I'd like to be relieved of the Queen! #ImperialistNonsense I hate today. #indyref

#indyref who are these 691 people incapable of making binary choices?  They must have very difficult lives.

Highest turnout since 1951! Never been so proud of Scotland as I have in last few months at passion  engagement in #indyref ! may it last!

This is when we should protest #bbcbias - they scared the nation  cost us at least 5% Campaign for an independent Scottish media #indyref

Hope this puts an end to those proposing UK secession from its neighbours too#indyref

Professor John Curtice looks as if he's been up all night! Oh, hang on #indyref #indyrough

Westminster should only start to feel smug about winning the No vote when its own system generates electoral turnouts like that.  #indyref

Alone within the United Kingdom , England now finds itself without a parliament dedicated to English matters #indyref #davidcameron

Really excited to see Devo Max. #indyref

Now let's get the rest of the show on the road. High time for change everywhere. #indyref

The Scottish referendum has put politics in the spotlight.  Lets hope there is positive change  #indyref

Do any serious news websites *not* have an interactive map of the #indyref results?

Looks like Glasgow and the surrounding areas are the only areas that voted Yes would there be any appetite for a Glaswegian state? #indyref

well those 10 'fraudulent' votes really wouldn't have made much difference anyway #indyref

William Wallace will be turning in his grave! which, ironically, is in London #indyref

Some good #indyref infographics here  although the coloured map doesn't really tell the whole story.

using music by Two Steps from Hell legendary. #indyref

I didn't have any convictions on #indyref but UKIP made the best point that YES would've simply been swapping British union for EU rule

Some days you just can't get rid of an union. #indyref

Scottish referendum was like divorce mediation with violent husband promising anything to keep his wifeWill he be able 2 deliver? #indyref

#Indyref is over! Just a great song for that - by contrast!   Sleep now!

Edinburgh YES 38.9%, but Glasgow YES 53.5% and Dundee YES 57.3% via #indyref

#indyref In case you wondered: Flemish Nationalist (N-VA) tweeted - somehow belatedly - they are NOT considering any referendum for Flanders

87% turnout is something to be proud of. Let's make like the Scots in 2015 and ALL get involved in how our country is run #indyref

BBC #indyref coverage over the 2 years progressed as follows: careless - bad-temperedly biased - gloating

Scotland rugby fans have lost the right to sing Flower of Scotland the Edinburgh luvvies need to start singing God Save The Queen #indyref

Aww you've gotta love a dramatic BBC montage. Cracking #indyref one on right now.

This outlier will be hot topic at $work! MT Dundee #indyref: Yes 57.3%, No 42.7%

Disapointment and embarrassment are 2 underestimated feelings today # scotland.  #indyref. ..

All said and done. stood up and fought for his country. Now it's time for an Englishman to do the same for us. #indyref

Why don't all the yes voters just fuck off somewhere on a boat and see how you do eh? #indyref

Will the nationalists who made provocative  threatening statements- 'a day of reckoning will come for those who #voteno' retract? #Indyref

Now Scotland have voted to stay in the UK in the #indyref perhaps they can start voting in politicians that aren't named after types of fish

I bet money that the 14% that didn't show up for the #indyref vote were all those friggin' nobles William Wallace was always dealing with.

The result in #indyref highlights that, whatever mistakes we've made, Ireland should be proud we had the guts to go it alone.

Very much looking forward to trip to Glasgow in Feb for  screening days - better together #indyref

#indyref almost 85% turnout is impressive. Cameron to tap into national feeling to ensure high turnout at next election #predictable

While many things need to change, it's good to see a campaign built entirely on lies and false promises not materializing. #indyref

#indyref   How much has it cost to run ?  How many new hospitals could have been built instead ??  #wasteful

Cameron and Miliband promising powers without Parliamentary approval is constitutionally arrogant #indyref

funereal atmosphere in Glasgow today. Is this how it feels to have made the right decision? #indyref

Salmond must be relieved that he wont have to reverse global economic trend  bring shipbuilding back frm Korea China  Japan #indyref

Has Westminster written cheques for Scotland it cannot afford to cash? #indyref

People of Scotland, let me introduce you to your next Prime Minister. Give yourselves a pat on the back. #indyref

A lot of Irish assume we have more in common with the Scots re national identity than is actually the case.  #indyref

After a successful 'No' campaign, Alistair Darling's eyebrows have announced they will be retiring from British politics. #indyref

#indyref turnout 85% v. PCC turnout 15% - perhaps one of the lessons to learn is voters do care - if they believe it will make a difference!

Thank god the Scottish people saw sense beyond the idiotic #alexsammond #ScotlandDecides #indyref his own constituents even said #no

I didn't completely trust Scotland would make the right decision, but I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised with their decision! #indyref

The UK has changed forever thanks to the #indyref. Job of all parties is to ensure that Westminster delivers real change to all parts of UK.

Video proof #indyref was #rigged !  Share/retweet! LET'S DEMAND A RECOUNT!!!!!!!!!

Depressing outcome of #indyref will be fight for right-wing voters between Cameron, Farage, and mantra of 'English votes for English laws'

EMAIL from ENGLAND!! Very valid!!! #INDYREF Yes its a relief It was not so close in the end - 55 /45

So disappointed at the turn out in Glasgow. 25 per cent didn't bother voting. Where were they all? #indyref

Woke up being #british and couldn't be happier. Never been prouder of being Scottish :) #indyref #nothanks

Almost 700 Scottish ballot papers were rejected because people voted both Yes and No #indyref

Hot off the presses, the final geography of Scottish independence. Based on real votes this time. #indyref

Who exactly were those 15.4% who didnt vote on Thursday then? #indyref

Here's a positive: #indyref facilitated lots of networking for ppl who want a fairer society. The minds of tomorrows politics are connected.

A great day for The UKlet's not do that again! #indyref #bettertogether see you at #natchamps ;)

Well deserved post #indyref scoff up: Simpsons on Strand with FT live team

Well if i were a betting man id have lost a lot of money on the #indyref , genuinely shocked no won. Scots will come toregret that methinks.

Unscientific: from 'no' voters in edinburgh overnight motivation was risks in independence not love for union. #indyref

I supported claims from both sides of the #indyref, so I'm pleased and disappointed by the result. That rebellion needs to spread, I say.

The Tories never had a problem with English MPs voting on Scottish laws before devolution. #indyref

Well, the No side won. What do you expect me to say? #indyref

Some of the posts I've read already are shameful and embarrassing. The hatred over all this is disgusting. #indyref

Had a fantastic time over last year reporting on #indyref from across Scotland. Worth noting: v few voters talked about more devolution

So, a comprehensive victory for common sense #indyref

Nothing worse than smug tories. #indyref

yes yes yes. Hope there's a similar groundswell of passionate debating #indyref

Well done Scotland I believe you made the right choice. #indyref

What a great democratic process in Scotland yesterday! Also glad to see outcome is Scotland to remain in UK! #indyref

So in fact a yes win would have been not what most people outside of Glasgow wanted. That would have been ironic. #indyref

I'm completely crushed but the Yes drive was a world masterclass in positive, informative and beautiful campaigning. #YesScotland #indyref

Now we see how England ends up in all of this. Devolution of powers to the regions or England as a whole an absolute necessity #indyref

Yep, it's all about the Banks. #indyref

Well that's a first, waking up to good news? #indyref

Though high, comparatively, a 75% Glasgow turnout still means 25 people I meet today at work chose not to vote in the #indyref. #themissing

Mapping the #indyref results by region is gonna be an unexpected quick job this morning: only four regions got a Yes majority

No vote was the right vote. Now Scotland should focus on its representation in London and improving access to funds #indyref

12 year old daughter just joined her school's debating club. She had a firm opinion - and made up her own mind about #indyref

#Scotland's vast #indyref turnout really shows that voter 'apathy' says more about the politicians on offer than it does the electorate.

I'm sorry it's a NO but glad for the Scottish #indyref sense of humour - how the night unfolded on Twitter

Democracy prevails  rightly so. I hope the outcome doesn't just result in complacency on Londons part! Was it all for nothing? #IndyRef!!

Another snap of double- speaking to BBC News earlier. Check the TV in the background! #indyref

Hoping that the #indyref result doesn't mean the addition of further levels of pointless bureaucracy to local government. #ScotlandDecides

Ed Milliband is making me cringe how he keeps calling Scottish people 'friends' #awkward #indyref #bbcindyref

Brilliant news that Scotland decided to stay in the UK. Now it's time to see the whole country change #indyref

I'm disappointed this morning because I can't take the piss out of statisticians and the size of their sampling. #indyref

Real winner of #indyref? Gordon B - come back, all is forgiven. Love or hate him, a good Labour politician

'Disaster'? The scale of the exaggerated pearl-clutching over the #indyref has been most amusing.

Well done Scotland, a vibrant nation, but Ed Millipede please shut-up man! #indyref

dont worry plebs, the new #iPhone6 is out so you tell the world how we're a bunch of spineless cowards quicker! #Scotland #indyref

Lots of bitter Scots on here today, get a grip you wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes as an independent country #indyref #bettertogether

Mood of #greenyes crew on the tram home ultimately one of pride. Everyone has made this campaign incredible. #indyref

#indyref think this may need some investigating

So many spiteful comments on the social media front this morning, from both sides. Didn't know it was wrong to have an opinion. #indyref

Camoron saying his heart would break if union divided when his vile policies have already divided the union between rich or poor!#indyref

Yes #indyref voters may feel down today bt I think result more exciting fr state as a whole, the #devolution debate is gonna b v interesting

No more Scottish Whiskey for whoever runs  #DrunkAsALord #indyref #ScotlandDecides

William Wallace must be turning in the grave.. #freedom #indyref

#indyref no word can describe how disgusted and ashamed I am of 2 million people in this country

Don't you dare sit on your laurels, you and your Government caused the #indyref  #wakeupcall  Not that you ever listen!!

A UK that remains intact is a more secure  nation in the face of extreme politics on the continent. 2/3 #indyref

Am more heartbroken than I thought I would be. I hope those who voted no are willing to actually fight to make it better together. #indyref

Bad news Scotland. I'd like to move to an independent Scotland. Away from the sly, ex-bullingdon wanker elite in this country #indyref

Lots of disappointed people today but I think Scotland made the right choice. Economic case not made. #indyref

See the transcript and video of #Cameron's statement on the outcome of #indyref here:

#Scotlandshame  =  the NO voters of Scotland! you have imprisoned us all!#indyref

Thank fuck for that..what a prick! Please don't come back! RT Relax. I'm leaving. #indyref

I think one of the major reasons for such a brilliant turnout in the #indyref is that every vote counted.

1st tweet since result. Civil approach failed due to State lies, fear mongering, duplicity.THERE WILL BE NO FUCKING RECONCILIATION! #IndyRef

Amazing turnout for #indyref If only there was that turnout in general  local elections. Maybe needs similar media hype to encourage it

A little sad that (55%) Scotland said no to #independence but we should fix the #EU treaties for split up of states etc. #staytuned #indyref

Does this mean the battered Mars Bar will still be available? #indyref

#Tories can try to spin Scots #IndyRef result as their achievement,truth is, #GordonBrown had to pull nuts out of the fire

off to Dublin for a big #CultureNight extravaganza, will need pints later to commiserate just gutted for Scotland #IndyRef

Whatever your views on the #indyref outcome,it's good news for Scot' resi market predicting prime prices to rise by 23% by 2018.

This #indyref does seem to be waking a lot of people up, politically. Good thing

To ease your #indyref pain, I bring you good news: I've just got to level 39 of Candy Crush; level 40 sooon!

Clackmannanshire result reflected the overall vote. Next time, can we vote only in Clacks so we can all get a good night's sleep? #indyref

I'm massively relieved common sense prevailed. Now, can we have a turnout like that at all elections please. Well done Scotland. #indyref

Arr, fairly warned, be ye, says I. #TalkLikeAPirateDay #indyref #novote

The final council area #Highland has voted #NO in the #indyref.Yes: 78,069No: 87,739That's 28 areas #novote, 4 areas #yesvote.

I guess the big win in #indyref was the 85% turnout. Congrats to both sides for running great campaigns  igniting the interest of a nation.

2,001,926 #nothanks, 1,617,989 #YesScotland in the #indyref. Contact us for insight in to the results and what could happen next. #Scotland

All Scots should now move to England  take English jobs, That'll really annoy Farage  totally confuse those who believe the twat.#indyref

84.6% turnout is a win for Scotland  an inspiration to the rest of the country. Cameron better not renege on his promises. #indyref

Glad the #indyref is over so all you 'Political experts' can go back to learning the difference between 'there' and 'their' #bandwagon

Seriously did the yes voters think Scotland can survive on on it's own, WHERE was the money coming from? #indyref

'Scotland the Brave' seems to have lost a bit of its charm now. :-( #indyref

Piers you're an expert on scandel! what your thoughts on the #indyref being rigged?

84.5% turnout for #indyref beats previous records for UK-wide and Scotland-wide elections:  #democracy

Dundee, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire  west Dunbartonshire chose hope over fear #indyref  The rest bottled it

Well done Scotland. Here's to a united Scotland within a United Kingdom! #indyref

I reckon I've got this whole #indyref thing all wrong

From whichever political viewpoint the people of Scotland should be hugely proud of an 85%turnout. #indyref

Main reason for No disappointment: Cameron interpreting a punch in the face as a pat on the back. #IndyRef

In pictures: Scenes of joy and despair in Scotland:  #indyref

Nice try Andy, fortunately the rest of Stirling showed more sense ;)  #indyref

We need proper time for reform of constitution to renew our Union. Rush it in the the run up to the General Election would be wrong #indyref

Besides #indyref news, I'm reading Station Eleven by  starting Rome Tales, a collection of translated stories. #FridayReads

Oh, the trains are quiet this morning. #indyref hangover, Glasgow?

Oh Scotland, you disappoint me.. Should've done it for the little guy! #StockholmSyndrome #indyref

We could have improved the lives of many people, instead we just damned more kids to poverty and more families to foodbanks #indyref #Yes

But whichever way Scots voted, they have been an inspiring example of democracy  civic engagement to watch #indyref

With the #indyref vote so close, I reckon Yes would've won had Salmond resolved the currency issue.  Amazing that he left it so vague.

#indyref shows UK needs written constitution  full federalism for all regions. But result means status quo draws strength

Let's hope the English Parliament decides on free uni education for all our teenagers #indyref

I think the most important question after #indyref is: Will we get an awkward scene in #EastEnders where Denise and Linda discuss it?

God Save the Queen and may He continue to bestow his magnificent grace on the UNITED Kingdom #indyref

#indyref let's now have a vote on whether we want Scotland to stay part of the UK , think they will get independence then

Even though I wanted them to stay, if I was a filthy Scot I'd be disappointed today. #indyref

#Labour's mask has slipped in #Scotland - stout defenders of the westminster elite  enemy of the working class #RedTorys #indyref

Last one (rlly). got poetic last night. Sympathy for Scotland  her separatists. #indyref

We caught up with William Wallace from (here 11-15 Nov) to discuss the result of the #indyref

Quite perversely the big winner in the #indyref has been Gordon Brown, who seems to have come out of it as a hero/saviour. Bizarre.

How will Scotland's No vote affect Labour? Read about the main issues here:  #indyref

I'm educating myself and watching feedback on the #indyref

Can England have a referendum now so we can vote Scotland out? #indyref

I almost want Nigel Farage to come to Scotland on horseback with a 'gang', lassoing No voters and their cats whilst hollering. #indyref

6% away from creating a nation, it seems ironic that Salmond's legacy is potentially now going to be the division of Scotland. #indyref

Separatists are patient, so they will wait and try again. You get a leader who can rouse a population and the game is back on #indyref

#indyref so 16% of people living here didn't give a f* about our country.write a cross on a paper was just too much work

Congratulations to my Scottish brothers and sisters, it is a great day for democracy #bettertogether #indyref

Ignore the paranoid tone of voiceover. What is going on in this #indyref count?

To celebrate the #indyref results, I got driven the 2 miles to work today. Thank you, Scotland, for the North Sea oil!

Milliband has all the charisma of two miss matched sports socks in a tumble drier that's unplugged. #indyref

The high turnout (84.6%) for the #IndyRef showes voter apathy  distrust of the main pasrties is a factor for the low turnout in elections

Here's with proud Scot Malcolm Campbell, who now lives in Yorkshire #indyref

Oh dear, don't think I've ever heard anything more cringe than Ed milliband referring to his audience as 'friend' #indyref  #cringe

#indyref sees record levels of voter turnout - almost 85%. Chief Counting Officer Mary Pitcaithly on -

For Sale: Job lot of Border Crossing control booths. Unused. Any serious offer considered. Contact: Alex Salmond c/o #Indyref

Absolutely - some inspirational leadership on both sides. One reason everyone was so surprised by Brown #indyref

How Ireland feels about the Scottish Referendum #indyref

The excuses not to give extra powers to Scotland has already started, not 4 hours after result. Don't say you weren't warned. #indyref

we called it weeks ago with our super scientific, don't-think-of-the-answer, yes or no game #indyref

So, given that the polls lied on #indyref, just how confident is Labour now of its wafer-thin lead as a GE predictor? #justasking

Yes supporters in Glasgow's George Square - still smiling #indyref  Only battle lost, war continues

Can't believe the amount of narrow minded and bitter people I'm seeing all over my Facebook and Twitter feeds. #indyref #getoverthatbridge

Enjoy your retirement Salmond. Your wife will even be able to join you on the golf course now!. Never mind #indyref

I feel bad for the 1.6m Yes voters. That's a huge amount of disappointed people regardless of how many more No voters there were. #indyref

#indyref Can anyone even begin to explain the comparatively pathetic turnout in Glasgow and Dundee? Any coincidence they're YES strongholds?

Proud of the turnout in Scotland! let's aim for the same % ;P #indyref

Sorry to the Welsh and the Catalonians who looked to us to set an example. #indyref

people scared into voting no , fear got the best of you. I'm proud to say I voted yes and Scotland will still never be the same. #indyref

First sack all those caught sleeping on the bench in the House of Lords. Then let's talk devolution!#indyref

So, #indyref is over. One of the most amazing days,  few months, of my life or anyone's. Looking forward to the new political normal.

Statement by President Barroso on the results of the #Scottish referendum:  #IndyRef

Blog: If you missed it here's Prof David Hunter's post on the referendum  health inequalities  #fuseblog #indyref

They are few and far between and certainly doesn't apply to all Scots but all I gained from this Referendum was anti English abuse #IndyRef

So can someone tell me of these new powers they promised us? #indyref

Scotland the meek. When has a country ever voted against its independence!! #indyref

#indyref 1- don't be constantly negative. 2- win by logical argument, not noise. 3- if you frighten the opposition, silence is hard to read

What the No people in the #indyref voted for ( not as the FT wrongly opines, to 'preserve' the Union). Westminster to deliver?

4 more big results for NO - Angus (+12%), Aberdeen (+18%), East Renfrewshire (+26%), Dumfries (+28%)#indyref #VoteYesScotland #VoteYes

I think the scots failed to get independence because Mel Gibson didn't offer an inspirational speech before the vote. #indyref

Error upgrading to Scotland 2.0 - Not found.Loading UK 2.0#indyref

I personally hope record-breaking #indyref turnout will mark new chapter in civic engagement in Scotland

Now #indyref out of the way, maybe we can start talking about what kind of society we want - not what kind of state

Congratulations Scotland! People have spoken. Regardless of results, democracy has won #indyref

That's a good Scotland, very well behaved.  Now let's see if I can find some little doggy treats to give you or not. #indyref

A great page of European history has been written. Thanks to the Scottish people. Now let's work to keep also the EU united! #indyref

Going to be talking to on about #indyref aftermath about 10.20am

#indyref well done Scotland, great decision! And as Zammo said on Grange Hill.Just say NO!

Well, that relief rally in the #sterling was shortlived. $GBPUSD is off by 100 points in less than an hr #indyref

not the patch on turnout when it matters though. 84% #indyref

Vote Yes to not talking about #indyref for five minutes

Gordon Brown very much an unsung hero amongst the media coverage of this #indyref result

A turnout of 85% is remarkable for #indyref and for Stirling to have over 90% of people shows politics matter when issues engage people.

If I don't see the headline 'Battered Salmond' today, every headline writer everywhere should be sacked. #indyref

it certainly wasn't an overwhelming victory as BBC reporting! #indyref

Scotland says no and I'm so relieved #indyref

84.6% of us voted in #indyref poor show for a huge event in our history. imagine how much less that would've been had 16 yr olds not voted.

If you like the music on BBCs #indyref montage right now, it's Heart of Courage by two steps from hell. Ironic, ain't it?

Westminister shat themselves and realised (to a degree) just how much they've let down the people. That should happen more.  #indyref

#YesScotland#indyref #voteyesWe now have an unelected lord overseeing the implication of WM. Promised proposals. Socialist Lord??

The moment Alex Salmond conceded defeat in Scotland's #indyref    Can't help but to be emotional

Plus, the Yes campaign was all for Scotland deciding it's future itself..it has, deal with it. #nothanks #debeal #democracy #indyref

Whereas YES Scotland was a democratic movement quarantined from England, maybe we'll set more than the heather on fire. #devomax #indyref

Re most of the reporting past 24 hrs  overnight: no I don't wanna hear the views of some fresher at Aberdeen uni SU bar #indyref

How the #indyref vote played out in the Highlands and Islands:

Would be interesting to see the number of first time (by choice) voters within the respective yes/no #indyref votes.

What's important now is for the UK to resolve its new constitutional issues ASAP so uncertainty doesn't creep back in. #indyref

At least Dan Hannan is one patriotic unionist Tory who's not using #indyref result to stir up English nationalism

Like future Labour govts possibly having minority votes on health, education? You've got a fight on your hands now. #indyref

Anyone helped Piers to the airport yet? Hand with his bags, etc. #indyref

The status quo prevailed but #indyref must spur change, writes |

Lovely to see the UK staying together, but the UK gov better live up to its promises. #indyref #scottishindependence #independencescotland

Brian Cox on bbc laughing up his sleeve when asked about more powers. I love you for that. Sums up for me at #indyref outcome.

10 things we learnt from the Scottish refzzzzzzzz. #indyref

Interesting- No voters I know already regretting their decision. Thought they made right choice but feel sad and flat this morning #indyref

84.5% turnout for #indyref is incredible and even better to see so many 16 and 17s engaged, using their right to vote

Realtime outside Scottish Parliament, searching for our dignity folks, he cannie find it. #indyref

Sir Ian Wood: oil exploration too low, signif offshore assets potentially for sale. #indyref result lets govts tackle those challenges

Yes victories were in areas of social deprivarion. #indyref was not about nationalism. It was about creating a fairer land

Wondering  Amazed how the latest video contribution for #wallfall25   somehow matches the result of #indyref so well

I'm loving the fact walk-on music is the backing track to the #indyref coverage on the BBC this morning!

Obviously gutted by #indyref result, hopefully people and politicians can come together to get Scotland the powers it needs to prosper.

This 'win-win' talk loses the point of the battle a bit. Something was lost last night, either we like it or not  #indyref

Honestly dreamt about trying to decide whether or not to buy a false nose off Limmy. #indyref

Congratulations on your coverage of the #indyref. had a good campaign.

Just reading responses to #indyref #scottishindependence, was I the only saddo watching it at 5:30am this morning?

The public involvement in the #indyref is a momentum we have to keep moving. Politics is about people!

Glad that Scotland voted #YesBritain - the world needs a strong UK. #indyref

So relieved that Scotland voted No!Team GB forever!Thank you for the chance to show how much we care#indyref

To settle the West Lothian question, the only possible answer is for England to secede from Great Britain. #indyref

The head not the heart won, but devolution will prove that Scotland can rule itself. Independence is only a matter of time. #indyref

An historic night of Scottish #IndyRef results, in pictures (it was emotional)   PIC:

Darling says we had to be negative to get our point over, well that sounds convincing. #indyref

The things people are saying just because they lost out to a yes vote is disgusting! We are still Scotland, yes or no. Be proud! #indyref

Great to wake up and see common sense prevail! And a stronger pound to top it off! #indyref #bettertogether #ScotlandDecides

A new labour party is needed for Scotland - no Yes voter will trust this lot ever again. Who's going to start one? #indyref

Overnight trading for #indyref pushed $SPX (SP 500) higher in line with $GBPUSD. Until 9am - when the pound gave up.

England, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy given 1 easy win in the 6 Nations following Scottish No vote #indyref

Possible the saddest picture I have ever seen:  #indyref

Disappointed with the #indyref result. I can just imagine Cameron giggling with relief at 4am this morning. 'We got them, they fell for it'.

Just seeing the face of Salmond and Sturgeon when they lost made the whole referendum campaign worth while #indyref

BREAKING NEWS: Here is my reaction to #Scotland's #IndyRef outcome from outside #Holyrood.

Although I favoured Yes I was never a fan of Salmond. However, his speech this morning was very dignified. Wounds must be healed #indyref

#indyref send us sample of your indy campaign material to Sarah Bromage Stirling Uni Political Archive FK9 4LA Plse RT

Nicola Sturgeon will be the one to tip things in our favour. I don't know when, but hopefully before she's Salmond's age. #indyref

Interesting to see that Scottish 16-17 year olds are the age group with the highest percentage of 'yes' votes for independence #indyref

Still getting my head around the #indyref result and consequences!

#indyref so when do we get to vote whether we keep the scots then, now they've admitted in their masses they need us?

Can us English, Welsh and Northern Irish now have a referendum to see if we actually want them? #indyref

If this wasn't the first song on BBC Radio Scotland after #IndyRef result, they have no sense of humour via

If someone was 45% sure they wanted a full divorce from me I'd take a good look at the relationship and change it, and quickly too. #indyref

Many of the no voters voted due to the fear campaign  selfishness. The selfishness drilled into them through years of Tory rule #indyref

Being awake for the #indyref seemed like such a good idea last night Now I'm paying for the #indyrefallnighter #shattered

Voted No?! Don't go blaming Westminster for a damn thing when it goes to pot Your fault.Thought better of you Scotland#Indyref

#scotdecides #indyref I am curious to know, of the total voting turnout, what percentage are actually Scots? 1 of 2 .

Politics in the UK has changed forever. Only way forward is regional devolution. Centralised Government is dead..!! #indyref

15 minutes left for me to talk to anyone in the media about #IndyRef. Then afterwards I head home. At last. Still at #Holyrood.

Now that #indyref is over, I wonder how many more front page proclamations of love I'll see from Westminster to Scotland in my lifetime?

Went to bed at midnight, woke at 6am to news, gutted, cried, slept again. 87% turnout was brilliant though. Now, about that vow #indyref

Sons of Scotland. Mel Gibson died for your freedom. He'll be pleased you voted yes #IndyRef

I'd said, whatever the result, the Yes campaign's been a great success. To maintain such momentum in the face of mainstream media. #indyref

If even *some* re-engaged by #indyref join a campaign, petition an MP/MSP, march for a cause, volunteer or donate, we'd be on our way!

Stop saying the vote was close in referendum it wasn't the pro English pro imperialist won by a big margin, the scare mongers won. #indyref

Saddest thing I heard yesterday was a load of 16/17 year olds that work in the same place as Porter saying they voted no because #indyref

What the hell are those eyebrows on Sky News right now #indyref

lets hope #Scotland put as much effort into ousting the Tories, in the next general election as they did in the #indyref

One of the biggest lessons of #indyref is that NHS will be a huge 2015 battleground.  many yet to be convinced its safe in Labour's hands.

Conflict-torn land can still stop sinning  obey God. #NothingElseMattersMT Scotland #indyref results.

Why is it Cameron can snap his fingers  allow a Scotland #IndyRef, but not give the EU Ref he promised his own voters? VOTE #UKIP

Best of luck to Scotland after a momentous occasion #UKpol #indyref

On talking about #IndyRef before a mad dash to for interview

Anyone making badges 'I voted YES 2014' to wear when we go abroad #indyref

First action after the #indyref result: cancelled my Herald subscription, next up - how to cancel BBC licence fee.

Not long before the cries of vote rigging  unfair counting started, surely it's in everyone's interest to move forward together #indyref

85% turn out! Regardless of how you voted in the #IndyRef - well done on making it the best turn out in UK history.

No name-calling - but there were two sides to the #indyref social media phenomenon.  Not the wave of positivity some claim.

Most voters in #Glasgow prefer to to be ruled by #Edinburgh. But most voters in Edinburgh don't! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Idea that Gladstone would have been a legend on social media has given me a v groovy idea for a project post #indyref blog. Sleep? Nah.

So I just have to wait until people my mum and dad's age are dead before another #IndyRef? Excuse me if I don't rejoice in that fact.

'I always thought you were holding me back but turns out you were holding me together' #indyref

I wonder if there's an after party in George square tonight? #indyref

People have voted, we have the answer. Stop the criticism. Team up. Move forward together. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I hope going forward that #AlexSalmond holds #Westminster accountable for promises made in the last days of #indyref.Otherwise:/#Scotland

#indyref - exactly what was more important for the other 15% - (turnout) Poll - were they washing their hair or.

Huge percentage of us voted. Still there are those who didn't bother. To those who were able and didn't may you remain ever silent #indyref

Older people in Scotland have learned to distrust dreams and promises. Good. But they believe the BBC a little bit. Oh dear. #indyref

Highest turn-out since 1918. #indyref It just shows how piddling the differences are between the national parties come the general election

The first two Qs in the Ashcroft poll indicate why online sentiment was at odds to the final count  #indyref

Thank fuck for that. Goes to show that the Yes voters were just a vocal minority but now the country will be more divided than ever #indyref

Marched on Westminster for an English Parliament 8 years ago..the #indyref is finally making others see the injustice of the devo settlement

Like a conspiracy as much as next person (unless the next person is David Icke) but idea that referendum was rigged are just daft #indyref

Jean Dorion and Liza Frulla will be on at 7:15 a.m. to talk Scottish referendum. Tune in 88.5FM/104.FM! #indyref

In the interest of keeping an open mind throughout the #IndyRef campaign I followed some with views different from my own. It's a big world.

If only that many people would turn up and vote at a general election #IndyRef

If my hubby said that while he was happy 55% of the time, 45% of the time he wanted to leave, that wouldn't bode well now would it? #IndyRef

I have nothing but pain and sadness inside, but to the wonderful #FamilyOfYes on social media, I say a big thanks. I love you all. #IndyRef

Those who were undecided got bamboozled by the Westminster run media and their scaremongering. #indyref #nofuture

Scotland just showed the world what Democracy looks like. High turnout and zero bloodshed. I salute you #indyref

its not a united kingdom. 45% of scottish citizens don't want in on it but now have to endure the same as us down here. #indyref

The Urban-Rural divide in #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides results is pretty clear.

The challenge after a negative result is keeping as many of the 84% of the electorate that voted engaged in politics. #indyref

Thank you, old scared people! #indyref

Arithmetic of that table says 54% of under 55s voted Yes #indyref Look on today as being another day closer to independence.

Whichever way you wanted the #IndyRef to go, I think it's a great example of democracy in action that the rest of the world can learn from.

Suspect the #indyref is a no for now. They'll be back on it in a couple if years

The #indyref must be the only time that 'Better Together' has been touted by millions as more negative than let's split up, eh

I have a broken heart today - but it still is full of pride  love  hope. #indyref #loveyes #HopeOverFear

nightmare for Miliband Labour Party  #indyref Labour should never have 'stood alongside' Tories

#indyref  It  was hardly a fair and democratic process they way media and politicians behaved. It's been shameful.

Explains why there was no big street party celebrations. All the old yins in their kip ;) #indyref

#indyref Scots made right decision to stay in UK, majority saw SNP had no economic plan. Good for UK, good for Scotland. Now fallout begins.

The people of Scotland have spoken. We have chosen unity over division and positive change rather than needless separation.  #indyref

Congratulations to the #bettertogether team for such an awesome campaign. They've been rewarded with victory. Together as one. #indyref

Shitebags man fuck off tae England #VOTEYES #indyref #scottishvines #Scottishviners #glasgow

Yes share of the vote bang-on what the Nats got in 2011. Interesting to see what happens when turnout falls back to earth. #indyref

That moment when BBC pundits said there's no example of a federalist system with multiple states operating under a central gov't #indyref

#indyref   Only thing ever going to make me feel better is the annihilation of Lab in Scot.Joined SNP this morning.They deserve our support.

the no vote in #indyref is the political equivolent of waking up after a bender, hungover and realising who youve woken up next to #awkward

Historic day today but the right choice has been made by the Scots! Independence never would have worked #bettertogether #indyref

The market reaction so far to Scotland's #indyref has been for sterling to strengthen in the currency market

I'd love to see another #indyref in two year's time, when the Torys are still humming and hawing over these 'new powers' they promised.

With all the devolution implications, the #indyref result for NO could prove the most pyrrhic victory since John Major's 1992 election win.

In the end, the #IndyRef turned out to be a lose-lose situation for one quite important person

A hyperfederalized Europe is a leftist dream  only path towards true democracy. No wonder entrenched interests are against #indyref

#indyref where does Scotland go now? Are we a country are we a nation.? Are we just a region of the UK?

Scotland, you can have your mist back now #indyref

Ah, so now we know. The Yes vote failing to win in Scotland is the fault of the media. Do me a favour!! #indyref

The Scots were highly energised  politically engaged by #indyref campaign. They will not be pleased vote promised on 27-3-15 wil not happen

The dream of a better world isn't dead. Unfuck your shit! Get motivated and re-organise! Hell, take a few days off. But fight back! #IndyRef

it just me or is Salmond a very naive politician.  Doesnt look to have any form of ruthfullness  stunned about others politics #indyref

Salmond may have divided Scotland but he ran one hell of a campaign and provoked the participation our democracy can only dream of #indyref

what better way to commemorate the #no victory in #indyref than watching this beauty?  cc:

Considering weight of issue, #IndyRef's 86% participation rate (as awesome as it is) actually seems a bit low. 14% didn't care enough?

No great fan of Salmond, but anyone who ranted and raved about him or voted No because of him/the SNP, you have your wish. #indyref

Reminder from #indyref : the youth vote remains the hardest to get to actually show up at the poll.

But still, he didn't have the power to sell anything else and what he did do was really good. #indyref was exactly what the Uk needed.

So disappointed with the results, was hoping to wake up as an independent country #indyref

The man who would be King has resigned.   A double victory.  #indyref

IMHO the result of the Scottish #indyref vote was (at 55.5% No to 44.5% Yes) a lot more conclusive than what a lot of ppl expected.

After the Scotland #indyref, the United Kingdom has to make some serious, fundamental changes.

wasn't a fan but bit gutted as I was behind him during the full yes campaign, gutted it wasn't a yes for independence #IndyRef

Read our initial response to the #indyref result

most youth who took part in #indyref feel betrayed by over 40s - look voting demographics

Delighted that has shown his true colours. Like a spoilt brat hasn't had his own way so quits in a strop. #indyref

As a comparison: 2011 NI Assembly election, nationalists - SF/SDLP - got 41.4%: SF 30%. 45% of Scots just voted for independence. #indyref

I reckon Murdoch knew Salmond was a silent force, hence Sun reticence on 18th #indyref

I can understand people might be upset but 45,000 people asking for a re-vote really? #smh #indyref

It is certainly the case that Nicola Sturgeon is an extremely capable politician and hence well placed to take over. #AlexSalmond #indyref

Thanks old people. Just fuck up our future when you'll be deed before shit hits the fan #indyref

Very moved by Salmond's decision to resign, his statement,  that he's told the right wing press to bog off. #itsthelittlethings #indyref

The political reputations of Cameron, Clegg, Miliband and their parties are staked on delivering DevoMax on schedule. Got to happen #indyref

To the 1.6 million of you brave and adventurous souls, lets not lose momentum #follow each other on twitter #KeepTheDreamAlive#indyref

The most shocking thing that has come out of this #indyref for me is that Nicola Sturgeon is married!

have a holiday Blair your work here is done. #indyref

know what would ease the goodbye to #indyref? Treat yoself to a suit onesie.

Pro Union and Yes supporters face of in George Square. Pics #indyref

If our descendants ever forgive us, I'll be surprised. #Scotland #indyref

#indyref must live on. Don't let the movement die

So I guess I'm still just British? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

WATCH: Here's the link to the live feed from George Square, Glasgow.  #indyref

I can't see why resigned? He had no reason to, as the #Yes movement was amazing!! #indyref #c4news

: to step down as First Minister : love him or loathe him, u can't question the passion with which he fought #indyref

says Salmond fails 'would you buy a 2nd hand car off this guy?' test #indyref

Just to be clear. #Scotland didnt stay for their love for #DavidCameron. This is not a win for him. This is a loss for #AlexSalmond #indyref

Pr. Sargsyan on #Scotland #indyref: ppl future status was determined in peaceful way, it was done thrgh free debate.

an unbiased media, not to have to vote for decentralised power, iron bru to replace water, a pony. #indyref #Scotland

#indyref u lost, Go and have a cup of tea and chill out. It's over.

I wonder how many of those who 'danced on Thatcher's grave' voted No. #indyref

Scumbags in George Square causing trouble, really disappointed. Fitba small-mindedness has nothing to do with democracy #indyref

Why are they carryin on like this 4, they're never happy are they? Even though they cheated on the ref #indyref

Final results from the count of #indyref Should Scotland be an independent country?NO - 2,001,926- 55.30%YES- 1,617,989- 44.70%

can't help thinking that #fanny and #fish taste the same on occasion #Indyref #lochnessmonster

#indyref - the Selfish Silvers have truly stitched us up. Massive opportunity lost

legacy is: The world now knows Scotland is a FREE  WILLING partner within the UK and that's our Sovereign will #indyref

The behaviour of some of the No voters is fucking shocking!! #indyref. If this is what Scotland is gonna become.

mbt for to form the #yesscotland party to harness and build on the 1.6m who engaged with the movement. #indyref

Britian isnt even British anymore!! You all serve your European masters now,EMPIRE,my arse.#indyref

Can't believe Farage is on my TV screen shoehorning himself into even this news.  Seriously, what the hell has it to do with him? #indyref

As predicted #LazyOldScotFarts who wanted 2 stick it 2 their g/kids 4 not visiting voted 'NO' #indyref  via

The One Show has just outdone itself on the awkward front. Fucking hell. #indyref

. on what the referendum result means for Britishness  in #Indyref

I doubt they even voted. Those numpties couldn't even spell X. #indyref #georgesquare

I still can't believe the result #indyref

Trouble in George Square as Salmond quits. Both sides need to get a fucking grip, you'd think he was Mandela. #indyref

To be fair to Alex Salmond, his decision to step down in light of #indyref defeat is the correct and magnanimous decision.

In an ideal world, both sides would turn and go home. As it is each side is waiting for the other to blink #indyref

Glasgow recovers the day after #indyref: Dazed speaks to Scots on the post-referendum streets after the countr

Re: Scottish #indyref - Old folks get to have opinions  decide import questions too. Perhaps Yes needed to do better job answering their ?s

ye maybe we need Ross Kemp back to do another documentary on how much worse the violence in Glasgow is since the #indyref

Well, I have another reason to hate tractors #indyref Dumfries and Galloway is really terrible place to live.

Would like to congratulate for excellent coverage of the #indyref . Cannot believe is back for drive!

Don't tell me the cream buns are gonna do a #manchester on #glasgow now? #indyref

#IndyRef: It would be ironic if #England campaigns/votes for an English social democratic parliament.

The #Unionist rioters should start burning the nice areas..let those greedy,self serving #No voters realise what they just did! #indyref

My daughter left G Sq after the Mob marched round police then rushed the YES supporters to attack them. Please stay away #indyref

Westminster are going to screw Scotland. Already backing down on 2 day old promises. Bad move id suggest #indyref

Russian Election Observers: Westminster Rigged #Scotland's Independence Vote: #indyref

Author Colin Kidd's at Union and Unionisms explores Scotland's political thought  from 1500-2000.  #indyref

A world class politician of our time. Sorry to see you go. #indyref

If not for #indyref, the world might have missed the quirky genius of And I would not have learned so much re: Scottish geography.

The #indyref has finished what's a life again?

Live feed of Glasgow's George Square:  #indyref

Watching news tonight  seeing reaction from England  WM, for first time since #indyref result I feel physically sick #ScotlandYouBottledIt

Many ppl who swung it for no were probably anti monarchy and anti nuclear, and in the booth those things became just dreams again #indyref

having the audacity to call anyone else a bully is frankly mind-blowing #indyref

Today's #IndyRef-related inversion of the truth comes from Stephanie.#ScotlandDecides #IgnoranceIsStrength

I read that as Gordon Brown -  The man who sold out the people of Scotland for his Tory paymasters #the45 #indyref

we voted no for a reason I hope your a man if your word and give us more powers #indyref

so sad about this. This man was all about Scotland and it's people not about the glory. Gutted about the vote. #wetried #indyref

If we know one thing now, it's the lie that people aren't interested in politics, says #guardianlive #indyref

Looking forward to taking requests tonight 9:30pm-1am + playing Monster Truck's Theme song off my last album! #indyref

Want to hurry up and put an end to those troglodytes at George square? Cheers. #shockingbehaviour #indyref

Quick way for to get ahead in post #indyref debate. Declare for an English Parliament elected under PR.

God you really are bitter and twisted- an amazing amount of young ppl voted No #indyref

Glasgow problems .. We don't love thy neighbour . So many ppl are two faced .#GeorgeSquare  and #indyref and scotland club teams #2diffhings

#indyref one thing's for certain: This is not the end but the start of a new beginning for the #UK

C'mon Scotland don't let the world see a great city like Glasgow in such bad light. #indyref we are better than that.

How many 'NO' voters are now regretting it ? thinking ' did we just vote no to an offer of independence? #indyref missed opportunity

Fed up of feeling small when it felt like something so big and right. #indyref

not doing a good job at showing Cameron's vile attempt at destabilising in England #indyref

After a long  enjoyable night counting #indyref votes  a day of sleep I'm looking f'ward to being AR vs tomo.

after rival campaigners shaking hands on Wed night, tonight's images are sad to see. Minority of 200 v 3.6m voters #indyref

blinded by loyalty to the sytem that fails them. If carlsberg did irony..#indyref

Portrait I shot of before launch 2 years ago. Goodbye to a political juggernaut. #indyref

Yes. 2018 Scots #indyref not recognised by WM after 2017 UK ref to leave EU, Yes win = UDI

Cunts at George Sq just now And people were complaining about nationalism on the Yes side #indyref

Seems to be a pro-Union demonstration in Glasgow. Looks messy. Sad end to the day there. #indyref

done with commenting anymore about #indyref. I cba with the discussion going in circles. (not meaning with you-just in general)

Is watching caustic events unfurl George Sq? And you had the audacity to analogize us with fascism? #indyref

This morning it was Tunnocks, now I move to Belhaven Stout. I raise it to the good people of Scotland. #indyref

Maybe more than devo max for Staines,we just want a Westminster that reflects how we vote? #indyref #ProportionalRepresentation

very good, balanced  good natured on #indyref tonight. Esp Perth live ppl and the glamourous David Torrance :)

I'm going to see live in London next Friday. I wonder if he'll have much to say? Or any thoughts on the #indyref

Block all unionist media and journalists #indyref

Defiant #YesScotland campaigner during the earlier standoff #indyref #GeorgeSquare

I stand by my No vote but any No supporter participating in the events in George Square doesn't represent me or anything I believe. #indyref

I am not sure what to do next. Join SNP? Green? Maybe new party? This hope and optimism must not dissipate. Up to us. #indyref

Lots of talk about the property market taking off after #indyref, if you work in #property contact us for advice on your next move #career

Dozens of No supporting loyalists protest in George Square, as police gather  #indyref

And so the moronic element descend to misrepresent the decent participants on both sides of this well fought debate. #NotInMyName #indyref

supporters can't even be happy with a win. It's these violent idiots in Glasgow that are causing devisions in society #indyref

#the45 turned Glasgow into a party, a minority of sectarian scum turn it into a place for Nazi salutes. Scotland's shame. #indyref

The obligatory 'don't mourn, organise' post for #indyref from Edinburgh AF is pretty good.

You don't represent me, you don't represent No Thanks either. sheer ignorance. #indyref #yesscotland #georgesquare

Conspiracy theorising is quite funny given Salmond selected his electorate to exclude Scots outside Scotland and include children. #indyref

Scotland's #indyref campaign  result utterly fascinating; lessons  implications 4 elections eg gen next yr  4our constitutional evolution

Gutted and cant watch the news. Turned to itv2. Tomorrow never dies. It already has #indyref

Well done Scotland, wouldn't be the same without you #bettertogether #indyref

A large group of Yes supporters amass on the night of a No win. I'm sure it was to offer handshakes and hugs to the evil fascists #indyref

I amnow a member of as we will have an indy Scotland for my children and generations to come We move towards this goal #indyref

#Catalonia parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a law to hold their own #indyref

Over 84% turnout. How can we keep this kind of percentage voting?  These kind of numbers might keep politicians honest. #indyref

horrible end to day when people absorbing #indyref result but a bunch of people wanting a Friday night fight

Wooooooooooooooooooooooo #bettertogether I predict a riot I predict a riot. #indyref stay at home 45 guys!

How we so nearly laughed at Mr Oliver.#indyref

here's to the No's winning that one with a bigger majority than #indyref

Hang on, why aren't the English and welsh getting free uni and prescriptions..not fair. #indyref

Stop the Celebrations, Imperialists!! #indyref Scotland.  via Fantastic!!

#ScotlandDecides#indyref all #AlexSalmond did was to divide people we should all work together and share things more fairly in this country

Really wanted a Yes vote,1) To create a bolt hole to escape the Tories,2) To believe the London-based establishment COULD be beaten #indyref

sorry, please repeat that this divide is behind us. #IndyRef

Love Tamwar commenting on #indyref I love it when go to the bother of filming a last minute scene for social commentary. Fab.

#indyref stand down.the eyes of the world are back on kim kardishan's arse.

If Scotland had voted conservative MP's in for last 50 years, boy would they be the tail that wagged the dog. #indyref

Slightly shocked at how briefly thanked in his speech this morning, when the latter clearly saved the day #indyref

What's going on in George square has more to do with footie than the yes/no vote. Get a grip and grow up. #idiotseverywhere #indyref

Oh EastEnders. We don't need you to include a scene about the #indyref

The #indyref Prusecco is gettin' GUBBED, btw, in celebration ae #the45 YASS!

Here all of this time I thought that #indyref had something to do with the Colts game last weekend.

What would've happened if Yes Vote? Seems happy to bring in Sillars 'day of reckoning' #indyref

My night consists of braveheart and a bottle of whiskey with lemonade #drowningmysorrows #indyref

Really can't see how we can have a General Election next year before these issues are all sorted out. #indyref

The #Economist does a nice line in condescension. Calls Clackmannanshire: 'a deprived fief of the separatist SNP'. #indyref

It's going to get ugly in George's square! #indyref

Scottish Referendum Video Provokes Claims From Cybernats That Vote Was Rigged  #indyref #45PercentSaysYes

Scotland have been sold a pig in a poke #bbcaq #ukip #indyref

I'm so sad to see the way some people have turned on each other. We all wanted to best for our country, whichever way you voted #indyref

53% voting 'no' at #indyref is clearly undemocratic. 96.77% of Crimea voting to join Russia is totally not North Korea.

Absolute disgrace that some people were bringing religion and football into account when voting for independence #indyref

#indyref The good Prof was probably right on - he went on to take a 1st but in English. He, too, can write.

#indyref #GeorgeSquare2011 CensusProtestants = 32% (down 10 pts since 2001)Atheists = 36.7%Reason is winning out. Eventually

is that the same Tories you AND were allied with during the #indyref? Dead to me.

Last night George Square was full of hope and now it's littered with neo Nazis #indyref

Sorry, the snake oil they drank was the Vows. Will No peeps want the referendum over when they realise they've been had #indyref

Thanks for everything.  You gave the people of Scotland a voice which we would never of had before. A true leader #indyref

We seem to be stuck in a Hell of our own creation. #indyref #GeorgeSquare

Fantastic climax to Eastenders there. Danny Dyer  Shane Ritchie are up to something. UK's hardest doorstep challenge maybe. #Indyref

Well why would they believe the vows (and the timetable)? #indyref

y don't I believe u if u were serious u and Dave could get them thru sooner we're watching u  will hold u to account #indyref

Don't know what to tweet about now the decisions made#ScotlandDecides #indyref

I sincerely hope all of the unionists I shook hands with avoided getting involved in the trouble in George Square#indyref

the #indyref was an excuse for these people. This isn't about yes/no. But don't let the truth get in the way of a story

#BetterTogether is a lie London-centric millionaires perpetuate - read UK National Statistics data  #IndyRef #VoteYes

So when do we get to vote to dump Scotland? #indyref

Shouldn't we hang draw  quarter Salmon? William Wallace wanted independence  we cut him up..,#indyref

Is now the moment for the UK to consider becoming federal? #indyref #bbcaq

When you read this, don't laugh. The Russians really are too hilarious for words#indyref

Sad to see this opportunity has turned into being about football and religion #biggerpicture #indyref

Keeping the momentum going, just joined the after being impressed by throughout #indyref

but will u hurry up,  wrap-up this #indyref drama? You have my LinkedIn reco pending since eons ago. =/

Nobody killed anybody in #indyref  Historically, this very very unusual. Above all else, we are very lucky. -George Sq ?

Just realised #indyref asked whether Scotland would 'come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off'

This #IndyRef has provided more comedy gold than I could have hoped for, but after midnight, I'm switching back to non-referendum gags.

Here's our #indyref man on Orkney. Bit o' a coo!

So #indyref was pretty close in the end then Yes 44.7%  No 55.3% - An impressive result to have an amazing 85% voters turnout at the polls

Fucking nazi salutes in George square? I thought the result was embarrassing. Hang your fucking head in shame Scotland #indyref

The photo started circulating just as the live feed went down. Blargh. I'm sorry to have contributed to misinformation. #indyref

Really hope look long and hard at themselves in the mirror. You've destroyed your own party and our future. Cheers. #indyref

Politition's wanted people to take an interest in politics after the vote, wont happen, if anything apathy will now be worse. #indyref

I am proud to have been there on Scotland's last night of hope!! #indyref #corruptionisdeep #lastchanceisgone

Eating  Drinking in #Scotland: Celebrate/comfort eat after #indyref, #Scottish style:  #travel

Yes we can. No you can't. #indyref #weare55

#ScotsDecide whereas #No 'winners' did nothing rather than keep silent  just wait till the #indyref day. #Respectful, but make me thinking.

least politically  probably for Union too. Indeed, while want Scots to stay, if don't keep word would be right to vote again. #IndyRef

change not just in Scotland, but whole of UK. Clear things can't continue as they are and need true devolution across nation. #IndyRef

#indyref are you one of the13%  of the people who registered and did not  vote? can i ask WHY?

Now Ed MIliband joins in the #indyref passionfest. Says case for No vote comes from the 'head, heart and soul'.

If I could, I'd give #Scotland a giant hug. It can't be easy there today. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Sorry I was too concerned with the #indyref Will we have any union jack coloured auroras anytime soon?

#indyref #VoteYes  Yes, it is illegal to coerce a family member, friend or employee to vote your way in an election

George Square. I'm far enough away to be safe from flares that are being thrown, which is why it's blurry #indyref

As the sun sets on #indyref, the sun set beautifully across this United Kingdom as I flew home tonight.

#IndyRef The native in Glasgow are revolting. This is not news to the English.

On Sky now, Richard Branson talks about what it's like to be Britishlive from his Necker Island tax haven #indyref

This is what your NO vote did to us!Riot by Unionists in George Square. #indyref #bbcnewsVia

Also in tonight's MEDIAWATCH - #Russian observers say #Scotland's #IndyRef didn't meet international standards

Oh #Scotland, how we would have missed you#indyref

Just won a full size snooker table on eBay for a tenner! The only thing is it's made in Scotland and has got no balls!! #indyref #voteyes

So the 'violence' in the #indyref run up was a few cross words and an egg. Now, this from No supporters? Same?

The idiots in George Square were the ones that couldn't fill in their ballot papers correctly #GeorgeSquare #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Buckfast flowing in George Square, yeah? #Glasgow #indyref

Don't understand how people can say that the #indyref result wasn't democratic. 90% of people voted, and 55% chose no, therefore won

Dear Scotplace, now please clean up your damn litter. #indyref

Dramatic scenes in #Glasgow - police everywhere - flares being thrown #indyref  - the day hasn't finished with us yet

Hey my #indyref buddies, I'm not gonna lie, I've spent the day mourning, but I'm nearly ok now  ready to insist we get what they promised!

The ugly side of Nationalism has reared its ugly head. And it's not from the Yes supporters. #indyref

i watched a report earlier that described the scenes in george square as 'celebrating' on what planet? #the45 #indyref #scotlanddecides

Scotland is the new Northern Ireland. (circa 1995) A divided country with hopefull nationalists having to suffer hatefull unionists.#indyref

Plenty of support from English people during #indyref poll  for #yes.

if there's anyone out to stir up hatred post-#indyref it's the meatheaded fuckwits in George Square rn

AAaah Scotland. You had one job!!!!.#indyref

I'ts a pleasure having an amicable conversation re #indyref  with but an earlier tweet re me moving  to Scotland is true

seems all the talk of coming together after #indyref was apparently dependent on a yes-result.

Cameron promises 'home rule' for England as Scotland says No to independence #tomorrowspaperstoday #indyref

Cameron must have threw back the keys to the cages as he exited Scotland, the result unionist thugs running rampant! #the45 #indyref

It's very sad that Alex Salmond resigned. He seemed decent, articulate with great integrity, just what Scotland needs now #indyref

Could we afford another layer of government/sponges #indyref

From my timeline, it seems that the whole of the 45% have just joined #indyref

Hi, have signed your admirable petition, but you could add hashtag of #indyref to

So when do we magically become better together? #indyref

This is the saddest thing I've seen. Do you know how much damage your doing to Glasgow's reputation right now? #indyref #GeorgeSquare

Cameron, Dribleyband and Clegg  England expects and is fed up with Scotland being given preference #indyref

Truly humbling, the smell of cordite and the red hand of Ulster flying high in Glasgow #indyref

Good night, Scotland. All the best. #Aye #Yes #indyref  Duncan MacRae of Kintail's Lament Pibroch

There's a new book out on the dark arts of political propaganda. Chapters on the Nazis, the Soviet Union  the BBC. #indyref

What a fortnight! #yorkshire win County Championship and the #NoWins the #indyref

Commonwealth buzz replaced by a more sinister vibe in Glasgow city centre tonight #indyref

No respect for unionist no voters, especially rangers scum, shouting abuse to people in George Square and waiving nazi salute..smh #indyref

I hope that people of both sides of #indyref stay safe in Glasgow.

My timeline is full of the abhorrent acts of violence in Glasgow and all I feel is shame. That's not us, that's not Scotland. #indyref

Welcome to Unionist party City under siege Saltires burnt Nazi salutes Ta lots for support #indyref

#bettertogether #ukok thugs on the loose in Glasgow City. Shameful. Embarrassing.  #indyref #knuckledraggers

Having my favourite drink in honour of #indyref

Thugs  bigots in George Sq dont represent any of us who took part in #indyref that was democracy scenes in the Square are disgusting

Sad scenes tonight. This is a horrid minority, please remember that and keep yer heids. #glasgow #indyref #moronicminority

He defied the odds, conjuring impossible victories - the story of Alex Salmond  #indyref

these were exactly my apprehensions. This #indyref has divided the people right down the middle. 1/2

Had to write in a note- #Twitter needs more letters! #indyref #Independence #ScotlandDecides #Salmond #the45 #gutted

Guess we really never will get that Braveheart sequel. #indyref

where's your coverage on the stabbing of the yes voter tonight in Glasgow? Good job.  #indyref #bettertogether

Don't get disheartened, keep this fire burning. I have just joined the SNP.  #indyref #VoteYes

This democratic revolution won't stop at the Scottish border. Join us in to secure more powers for a fairer society #indyref

Just had a wee greet there. It's been building all day. Feel better now. #indyref #thedreamwillneverdie

#Yessers Let's keep this thing going. Join a party or organisation affiliated 2 . We had a momentum. Don't let it die #indyref

In the shadow of the No vote: What next for the United Kingdom?  #no #Wales #indyref #Westminster #English

scotland shat its tartan underpants :P muhahahahaha #indyref

You accused YES Scotland of organising intimidation. Is #GeorgeSquare violence your revenge? #indyref

Well done Tories let you do all the work on ruining our #indyref then stabbed you in the back, you idiots.

Please help support 45 percenter, add a #Twibbon now!  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Wildly overstated conclusion, but that woman has questions to answer.#IndyRef

Yes campaigners reaping the seeds they have sown #indyref #Karma

Better Together are to blame for the Glasgow riots.  They whipped up the sentiment and now this is what we are left with.  #indyref

ICYMI: A NO voter in Scotland, a few hours ago, giving a Nazi salute in front of a war memorial. #indyref #Glasgow

It's heartbreaking.   The future's been stolen from us #indyref #the45

#indyref is the most active trending topic now in Preston with 167 tweets per minute

Row brewing over English powers So #Westminster lead by liars!! #indyref

This is just awful. We had a peaceful #indyref and now our country is being let down by unionist, racist thugs. #45% #indyref2

You're not still buying Tunnocks are you? If they'd wrapped them in wee blue saltires, they'd have made a mint! #indyref

Cometh the hourwho would have thought? #indyref

looking forward to the film version coming out in several years time #ScotlandDecides  #bettertogether #indyref

Next time Scotland WILL vote for independence.  So rest of UK should get prepared for the inevitable. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

getting massive boost to their no's following #indyref. Time for England to follow suit  make a change?

The is the only analysis you will need of the Scottish referendum. Ever.  #indyref

appreciate the sentiment mate, a lot of folk from the crowd approached me after the crowd dispersed, to say the same #indyref

It feels so great to have kept our country together and there is a fantastic chance to refresh everything - really excited #indyref

#indyref When will bombs be going off ? False flags. Create division play one side against the other. New meaning of climate change.

All 1.6 million fighting spirits !!!!! Not to be sniffed at me thinks ;) #indyref #SCOTLAND

Indeed. But this is nothing new in Glasgow football circles, alas. Not just an #indyref issue.

#indyref #georgesquare terrible footage  photos of Unionsists. Is that what NOs voted for SECTARIANISM? This all feels like a mistake.

Seeing Belfast united for #CNB14 Glasgow divided over #indyref makes me question my move here. Came here to avoid all this.

Why the fuck would no voters be rioting? They won! It's the yes junkies causing it as usual!!! #indyref

This might cheer up some of the #Yes voters, new national anthem for #No voters #indyref

why would we want the entire world seeing these thugs? Not even yes or no, just arseholes looking for a fight! #indyref

since when did peoples age's go on the ballot papers? #indyref #jealousbastards

Sorry. No dice from me. I will never again legitimate a WM election with a vote. #indyref Withdrawal.

How many other 'Yes' and 'English Scots for Yes' badges will there be on the London Tube tonight, I wonder? #Yes #indyref

One thing we learned #indyref : twitter is a fiction

Keep up with the #indyref reaction as Alex Salmond announces he is to stand down

Our #scotnight special begins in 45 mins. After a remarkable 48 hours we'll cover every #indyref angle. #ScotDecides

misogyny goes hand in hand with all forms of ignorance. #indyref

This #The45 thing sounds like a shit Sky One drama series. Maybe it is! #indyref

He has got so many people talking abour politics because of the referendum and 45% in scotland wanted independence #indyref #AlexSalmond

Scottish supporters of #YesScotland  have updated their avatars w/ 45s to show they are part of the 45% Yes vote. Awesome. #indyref

#No voters claim to be proud Scots. Yet they burn the Scottish flag. This is why we should of voted #Yes #indyref

#indyref That's just soundbite pish. As was the yes intimidating no voters.  Comparing BT to nazis is hyperbole.

you know fine who they are, man up and say it. #indyref

Thanks again for the tweets about Alex Salmond  #indyref. We'll RT some more now.

Union flags and Nazi salutes? The idiots just don't get it! #indyref

Scottish referendum turned out 85% of the electorate. Here are more #indyref results:

'For Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die'Thank you Scotland's greatest ever politician. #indyref

Oh and today just keeps getting better! So long Salmond!! Now if we can just get rid of UKIP we can all get on being British! #indyref

Why the fuck is BBC saying result is decisive? 10% ain't a huge difference #indyref  #VoteYes

Alex Salmond  #indyref  I prefer your new hairstyle

16 year olds voted #indyref what they been teaching 'em in Scottish schools? That Hitler's Nazi Germany was a sound idea ?

#indyref #ScottishReferendum Alex Salmond's biggest mistake?  Not letting the English vote in the referendum - he'd have won by a mile!

Am sure votes cast done on best reasons and evidence, which people can disagree over; not afraid or anti anything, different views. #IndyRef

why are you not reporting the unionist riots in Glasgow? If this happened in London it would be the number one story #indyref

Best bit of #indyref last night? Sarah Smith correcting Nick Robinson's hopless misreadings for hours and hours and hours.

please provide me with an update on progress you made today following No vote in #indyref.  You promised you'd start today.

#Abkhazia #SOssetia  #NK see #indyref as exercise of self-determination. #Georgia  #Azerbaijan point out IDPs issue

The Unionists did this and they won. What would they have done if they'd lost! Burning homes instead of flags or cars or people. #indyref

I voted Yes b/c I thought it was best, others voted No b/c they thought the same. Either way, don't be ashamed of your nationality. #indyref

Were you outraged by these events that Manchester never had an apology for? #Scotyobs #indyref #novote

NO proof at all of burning Scots flags all i seen is pictures of the Union Jack flag little on sided huh! Proof pls Glasgow, #LIES #indyref

Sad to hear that is stepping down. Despite the outcome, he should be proud of what he achieved. #indyref

Surely one reason #indyref turnout so high was that every vote counted. Strong case for proportional representation in general election?

report on found some very articulate voters. Obvs #indyref galvanised politics. Would be great if that happened everywhere.

Worth noting this took place in front of the Cenotaph: a war memorial. #indyref #GeorgeSquare

Interesting, heard many praising when visiting Scotland. #indyref

England you're a monster. Don't think that you have won. We'll never be defeated whilst Scotland has some sons. #indyref

A fascinating #indyref  commentary from the #guardian and a Scottish poet Laureate

What is the point of this battle? They won didn't they? Looking for trouble.  #bettertogethermyarse #No #indyref #menbehavingbadly

Cameron is trying to divide the Labour vote in the North and Scotland.  #indyref

How can Cameron hope to solve the West Lothian question in a few months that hasn't been solved in years? #indyref

I am getting increasingly annoyed with this talk about English issues, English MPs and English tax payers. Wales? N Ireland? #indyref

They desecrate our big friendly Yes city. Thugs. #indyref #new45

Loved the interview with two girls in George square, ends with one pushing the other away in a shopping trolley. #indyref

hardly appropriate. The man is a living #legend the fight will continue #indyref #freescotland

Any chance this is like Groundhog Day and we can try again when I wake up? #indyref

Any reason why is ignoring unionist riots in Glasgow tonight? #indyref

Feel like Scottish referendum caused a trend in devolution and independence #indyref

You know it's bad when the right-wing gobshites are reporting it negatively. #indyref #georgesquare

Blanket use of #backofafagpacket to describe UK govt policies on news today #indyref #nhs #thamesestuaryairport - as good approach as any?

Campaigning in the independence referendum is all a lot of fun - until somebody loses an Aye. #indyref

The Yessers using #WeAreThe45 #the45 need to get over it and start building bridges. You LOST get over it. #indyref #voteno #scotland

And this is #GeorgeSquare in Glasgow right now Friday 7pm: nazi salutes, jeering and threats #indyref

Quebec separatists mocked relentlessly amid #Scotland vote #indyref  via

A black day for Scotland. What does it mean to be Scottish in 2014? Where do we go from here? #indyref

I didn't think we would really get more powers but I didn't think it would start to collapse within hours #indyref

I have friends on both sides of of the #indyref. Both campaigns were excellent. Scotland, UK can be proud of their democracy. Inspirational.

55:45 is not 'decisive' to me. Clear, yes. But 45% is a lot of ppl. It's going to be a difficult few weeks for Scotland #indyref

Reporting #indyref opinion in Lincoln but not what's happening in Glasgow. Riiight

Following the Scottish #indyref, PM Cameron gives speech addressing devolution.

#Scotland if Cameron really believes in Devo-Max, why did he rule it out as 3rd option in #Indyref? to avoid commitment

#Scotland its been a rollercoaster. I've met so many great people here! Your journey REALLY has just begun. With u all the way! #indyref

Almost unwatchable - reporting on the #indyref from Lincoln. Zero perspective.

Qu If David, Nick and Ed were quote/ unquote concerned about the #indyref, why did they spend ONLY a day in Scotland

Obama's book 'The Audacity of Hope' has been renamed 'No Hope for the Scots b/c somewhere has to house our nuclear weapons' #indyref

Great that Salmond is going and Nicola Sturgeon was seen crying on television  - Cameron played a blinder sorting West Lothian Q #indyref

how right u were matey. All kicking off in #Glasgow post #indyref

Regardless of your political views the media coverage has been shameful. I feel justified in my continued ignorance of the UK Press #indyref

Well this Scottish season of #GameOfThrones ended a bit disappointingly! #indyref

What is wrong with people? We should be celebrating the sheer volume of ppl who turned out to vote no matter which way they voted. #indyref

Absolutely fucking shocking from the BBC, blatant lying and avoidance of reporting the truth #indyref

Scotland: 55% no, 45% yes, 0% devomax. So Scotland to get #devomax #indyref

votes decided , please all just love each other #indyref I love the fact important questions raised without divorce

Way to go pick an early edition Daily Mail so you don't have to mention #GeorgeSquare Bias! Never. #indyref

I feel like the only people more disappointed in the Scotland #indyref vote than the actual #YesScotland followers are Quebec Separatists

Vote ukip. My independence parody #indyref

Watching Buchanan St descend into warzone on Danish TV cos nothing on UK TV about it #mediablackout #indyref

Anyone who is interested in #indyref please follow for reasoned debate

You 16-17 year olds; really did your country proud. 73% of you for Yes. Bodes well for the next stronger wave of campaigners.#indyref

You thought you would #VoteNo in #Indyref for #Devomax, and now you're going to get shafted. Mugs.

Gutted the Scots put their faith in the shower of shit we call MP's. They had a real chance to change things. No wonder UK's fucked #indyref

Sir Tam Dayall on BBC Newsnight now re constitutional change and the union re Scotland and Westminster #indyref #Scotland

Scotland referendum: who voted YES? The young, the poor, the working class  #indyref

#BBCpapers nothing on the angry bigoted, Unionist mob tearing up George Square? If it was a Yes mob it would top your agenda. #indyref

Arseholes in Glasgow just arseholes acting true to form. Would have happened whichever way #indyref went. Is anyone truly surprised?

From commonwealth games to this!#GeorgeSquare what a couple of wierd ,joyful and now shameful months #indyref

Police separate rivals in Glasgow . Told ya #indyref

Democracy! When the entire establishment is churning out pro-union propaganda, frightening pensioners - shameful #indyref

My sister came to visit from Glasgow today, but now she won't be able to get back #GeorgeSquare #indyref

Thanks for all your votes but I'm afraid sleep will triumph over wine. I blame the #indyref.

Devo Max, blah blah none of it makes sense unless we tackle electoral reform first. That's a campaign to get behind #indyref

Mounted police on Buchanan Street. did an excellent job containing situation #indyref #Glasgow

One in ten GPs earns more than PM  I guess now #indyref done GP's are the Coalition's next target

Evidence of foul play in the Scottish referendum. Whether you're yes or no, the truth needs to come out   #indyref

Same as the #torylabour threatening promisesthey created chaos and division and rule with disorder #indyref

Russian officials criticizing the democratic process and implying the #indyref result was suspicious is the funniest thing I've heard today.

Union flags, flares and fighting in George Square. Are Rangers in administration again? #indyref

Kicking off in Glasgow  #indyref shame as we all know this has nothing to do with the vote

We were on the cusp of something amazing, but we can't give up now. 45% is a loud voice if we shout together! #wearethe45 #indyref

Ken Clarke seems to be suggesting new Scottish powers will be delayed#indyref

I have considered my position following the #IndyRef result but I feel that is not yet ready to replace me as #FunkMaverick.

So a no vote was a vote for certainty?  So far none of the politicians seem to be agreeing on anything. There's a shock #indyref

Media treating Cameron and govt as #indyref  victors.  Labour meanwhile peed off many of own supporters. Labour own goal.

Poor Scotland, conned by promises that were withdrawn after the voting. Like Ireland during the EU referendums. #indyref

For the record, i didn't vote out of fear, ignorance, cowardice or stupidity. Quite the reverse. Stop throwing mud and move on #indyref

Disgusted to hear what's happening in Glasgow tonight #signofwhatstocome #indyref

Scottish independence has turned into English devolution. #IndyRef

#indyref over now. The big boys down at Westminster will now, no doubt, sort all the issues which they are quite clearly fully in touch with

Sad to see Salmond resign, but he had tried so hard and got so far, but in the end it didn't even matter #indyref

All my new followers I gained during #indyref this is the usual standard of my tweets, I wont be offended if you unfollow.

There was a distinct lack of Yes people at polling stations. Only turned up for two hours total at one place #indyref

Scots died to defeat the nazis, the fuckwits giving the nazi salute are an insult to them.#arseholesoftheday #indyref

Wow, amazing country if you agree with #indyref result today or not some great photos   Love #Scotland

Near miss in #scotland #indyref yesterday. Lack of trust the reason says in latest column

Your hearts may be heavy but your spirit is not broken. The darkest hour is just before the dawn. Lift your heads. #indyref #ScotlandDecided

how many Scots have you sold down the river? Proud of the violence your pro Union victory has caused? #indyref

Let's hope we don't find that the Vow was a lie. #the45 will have votes in May and will hold them to account #indyref

Just high spirits from Better Together.  #indyref #BoycotttheRecord

can you tell us what you're going to do to  ensure BT pledges are honoured?  #indyref

I feel like we need to impose sanctions on Scotland Kick em out of the 6 nations perhaps?! #indyref  #sixnations #makethemplayforengland

#IndyRef:We just spent about the same on our new building as the SNP budgeted on setting up the entire Scottish state

Scotlands shame!  #Nothanks I wonder what theyd have done if theyd lost! #indyref

I know that only too well; this is my home  whilst #IndyRef has been occasionally mean, it's never been violent.

he said he didn't want to damage the No vote by airing his views before the #indyref

My hope hasn't died today. It's been rekindled #GoScotland #welldoit #indyref

To every yes voter in Scotland. You have my profound sympathy. I would be proud to hug each of you. No silver lining. #indyref

Gordon Brown, the 21st century Toom Tabard. Yet again he only delivered empty promises. #indyref

Well that was a wonderful few hours of democratic bliss in Scotland before the wankers the #indyref drew out of the woodwork began drinking.

From hope and pride to violence and shame in 24 hours. Disappointing end to such a promising time for scotland #indyref #GlasgowRiots

#indyref Scotland, localism / devolution is a panacea ( - Without own currency, best to have union / fiscal transfers

Glasgow, what's going on! Get these thugs off the street! #indyref

remember #the45 ers, we have decided to block al MSM, their bias won our #indyref , one bitten twice shy..#gettae#the45

ScotlandNo votersthe side that won the #indyref? You reap what you sow! #GeorgeSquare

All those comfy, middle-class and over 65 Nay sayers must be looking on at Glasgow with pride tonight! #indyref

85% turnout in #indyref shows that people can get involved  interested in politics. We must get message across that voting is important

Well BBC! Where's your coverage of George Square in Glasgow?!?! #bbcbias #indyref #yesscotland

Re that last RT, yes it can. Orange marches planned in Glasgow tomorrow #indyref

The high turn out in the #indyref has shown that give people a real feeling of being able to make a decision and they will get involved

The #IndyRef has done many, many great things, but the biggest thing to come out of it today has been the huge divide between normal people.

#indyref #newsnight 3.By 'reneging on The Vow' I mean not delivering more devolution to Scotland as quickly as promised during the campaign

R Far-right British nationalists are roaming the streets of #Glasgow to punish it for voting Yes. Think on that. #indyref

Well spotted sir. Who him?  #indyref #BoycotttheRecord

I'm straight up worried! Fires being started people being stabbed Glasgow is falling to bits at the seams! Cannot stand bigots! #indyref

isn't it ironic that these idiots would've benefited from a fairer society #indyref #Glasgow #GeorgeSquare

This we are #the45 thing is pish btw, you are #the99, same as everyone else. Vote is over, find common ground. #indyref

Whisper it but the 85% #indyref turnout is a tremendous argument for genuine proportional representation. For once every vote counted.

Despite of the decision of the #indyref, Scottish people yesterday made History! Democracy was exercised.

Listening to moaning defeated separatists in #indyref preferable to the economic crisis a yes vote would have unleashed today #newsnight

I dunno what's worse, the violence in Glasgow or the downright disrespect for the elderly. #indyref

bit of self awareness needed if you're going to lecture someone about being rude to strangers #indyref #rudeisrude

You won, what more do you want?!Why do you need to come start trouble?!Have some empathy some class people #indyref

Alan Little on #BBC Newsnight just summed it up For many Yes voters it was civic not ethnic nationalism. There is a big difference.#indyref

It's a sad state of affairs when voting is referred to as an act of betrayal #indyref

#wearethe45 More informedengaged people voted yes,we need to keep informing and engaging people, keep it alive,U cant undo smarts #indyref

Post-referendum: what we do next - Robin McAlpine,  #indyref

It looks like Scotland is more divided than ever #riots #indyref

it came up that  you unfollowed Doesn't matter anyway #indyref is done and dusted and things are right in the world again

After all over #indyref this week they're now turning a blind eye to what's happening in Glasgow. #shameful

after #indyref scotland failed to cut it's nose off to spite its face, resorted to kicking instead

BBC now stands for Buggering Bastard Cunts. Pass it on. #indyref

For all the #voteYes #voteNo ppl thinking of waving their flag in #GeorgeSquare tomorrow. Put them away pls, you'll hurt someone. #indyref

It is a bit wider than Glasgow - apart from that I agree #indyref

Glad the #indyref is over so we can focus on the real issue of #chemtrails !!!! #staywoke

However you you feel about the vote.. Be humble in victory or accepting in defeat. And please STOP the violence tonight. #indyref

And the good news is .. there will be an Orange Order March through #Glasgow tomorrow.#GeorgeSquare #indyref

wondered if anyone would compare #indyref to Crimea.

Scottish people burning their own flag, what an embarrassment! Better together aye? Sort yourself out!! #indyref #proudtobeoneofthe45

#Scotland is a worse off place without that Salmond chap at the helm. #indyref

Jeez Scotland. Alex Salmond wasn't offering real change for at least 18 months, yet you've not even given David Cameron a full day. #indyref

If it was YES supporters causing the trouble in Glasgow tonight would you not be headlining this?  #indyref

Och, grow up! These people account for less than 1% of the NO voters!  can't you see that?  #indyref

Quebec separatists, disappointed but ever optimistic, put positive spin on Scotland independence loss  #indyref

yolo MT [Plotting] life expectancy next to %#Yes vote in the #indyref by local authority

I didn't vote no to give this scum a reason to parade their vile hooliganism around glasgow #GlasgowRiots #indyref

Right! Have the yessers got over this now! Can we get back to normal? Oh no wait a sex crazy snp mp has just restoked fire! #indyref

Many positive of #indyref lost inside 24 hours How disappointing

Retracted that last tweet as the time line evolves, obviously just the usual nutter trash. Now I wonder if it's an EDL away day. #indyref

I feel lost, I hope all friends and family are safe in Glasgow  hope deal with these thugs! #indyref

Is this what happens if they don't get their cereal? #indyref #BoycotttheRecord

I am assuming the police have asked the media to soft-pedal it to stop yet more bampots turning up. #indyref

Did anyone know who Alex Salmond was before all this #indyref bull shit happened?

So #indyref over and the conclusion from all that in Westminster seems to be that English MP's need more power. #Scotland

Imagine if Scotland unilaterally declared itself a Republic as Ireland did in 1916 instead of asking for permission from Westminster#indyref

Listening to this 1968 version of Flower of Scotland makes me think 2014 is just another, passing, phase.  #indyref

A constitutional convention would tie up the civil service  Westminster for years. Means nothing. #indyref

You were catalans source of hope #indyref don't worry your not alone even the catalans are coming.

Really? Stabbing a fucking child. Get a grip you cunts. You're giving Scotland a horrible name. #indyref #GeorgeSquare #ShouldHaveVotedYes

I hope all of the innocent people of Glasgow are safe #GlasgowRiots #georgesquare #indyref

that might make the #indyref worthwhile? I hope things improve 4 common folk Life so hard!

Pray for unity of Scotland following #indyref, please.#OneScotland #Prayer

Idiots in #GeorgeSquare represent a minority have let #Glasgow down most of these Neanderthals won't even know what the #indyref was about

What is this a 3rd world country or a dictatorship of the elite? #indyref  via

UK should look at Canada's federalism and sharing of powers as a future model to parliamentary #devolution . #indyref

That cant be right; only the yes campaign indulged in any intimidation, remember that egg? #indyref

Apparently EDL are travelling up to join the fucknuts rioting in Glasgow. Fuck all to do with #indyref this, just bigoted arseholes

These people do not represent Glasgow or Scotland, No voters, Yes voters or the #indyref. They represent a minority of ignorance and bigotry

#Unionjack wielding thugs seem to be causing most of the Violence in #GeorgeSquare although I imagine it's not that blackwhite #indyref

#the45 may have started in Scotland but please feel free to join in if you value democracy, people power, and social justice. #indyref

Scotland's been had, again, and fascists are storming around Glasgow gleefully. This is terrible for us all. #indyref.

The fact that no one is reporting on the #GlasgowRiots makes me sick. Shows you how little they care now that #indyref is over and done with

Imagine burning the saltire. I can't even comprehend someone doing that. Makes me feel physically sick. #indyref

Well all I can say is the #bettertogether camp have a lot of work to do if tonight's events in #Glasgow are anything to go by #indyref

#indyref Interesting to see bitter nationalists branding unionists as fascists for being patriotic. Natonalism divides, socialism unites.

If the police would like to, yknow, POLICE, that would be really great. #indyref #georgesquare #riddy

will rid ourselves of Westminster. When oil, water and resources all used up we can go free but doubt it. #indyref

Yes campaign won Glasgow, so I'm guessing this is probably root cause of rioting #indyref #GlasgowRiots

Clearing up some media misinfo: The Glasgow #indyref riot was started by a pro-unionist rally, not both sides.

If #indyref has taught us anything it is that Political Parties are outdated! Real democracy comes with issue based votes NOT Party lines!

I'm proud of every Scot voter because regardless of how you voted, you stood up and demanded to be heard and that's half of battle. #indyref

l hope you're proud of the sectarian violence in george square tonight. afterall you played a blinder in the #indyref #cunt

I thought the media demonstation of #yes would stop post #indyref. Judging by the coverage of Glasgow, I was wrong.

That's true, but the #indyref started a conversation here as well - about how the Scottish parliament means you have

Go home EDL. Scotland  Glasgow don't want you. We've had a mostly civil and peaceful #indyref until these thugs showed up. #GlasgowRiots

Will Wales be more Cardiff centric after #indyref/Silk and WG Cabinet reshuffle? Newport 2nd fiddle?

Suddenly, #Shetland isn't interested in its own independence. Not important; just a phase. I wonder what being a pawn feels like. #indyref

Fascinating piece from long before #indyref, on how could change course in Scotland

with the history of Glasgow, Yes or No it was going to end in trouble - the tension last night didn't start with the #indyref

You can't rush constitutional change! I thought Scotland's #indyref was too fast! But England deserves even quicker changes? Not on ur life.

#indyref #bbcindyref Recent UK governments have practised elective dictatorship. I doubt we will see a change with EVEL.

Summarising #indyref economically appeals to Indy USA

Really sad to read about the trouble in #Glasgow last night - Loyalists and Unionists 'celebrating'Sad end to an otherwise great #Indyref

Help. Are you 1 of the 45. If so I need your help..Please favourite and re tweet this to I find us all. #indyref #VoteYes

Did Scotland just turn into Northern Ireland overnight? Stabbings, riots, bigotry #indyref

#nothanks #indyref  Everybody that voted NO need to realise that their savings and house R at risk. NHS Scotland will B broken up.

Labour and Tories (better together) will not give Scotland the time of day, never mind Devo-Max, now Scots are back in their place. #indyref

Based on lst 48 hrs, if #indyref was today after the lies and disgraceful scenes from George sq, would we be looking at a landslide #Yes

please see my #indyref #stolenvote requests to #YES counting agents 2 write reports and RT

see wee #indyref we tht was abt us? NAW! All abt England's MOREpowers! #WeAreThe45

I love how Yes voters are putting '45%' on their Twitter pics, like they're Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games #indyref

Still nothing about #indyref on Sometimes I worry about the output of this news channel

Irvine Welsh: this glorious failure could yet be Scotland's finest hour  #indyref

i hope labour no voters are happy weakened your parties power at westminster #indyref

It's a disgrace  beyond miserable that the #indyref should have reignited the flames of sectarianism in Glasgow.

correct. Some Media been fairly poor throughout #indyref on both sides. Glasgows problem is its still rooted in sectarian divide.

If it had been a general election, 28 of 32 provinces would have been called a landslide victory #indyref

I hope everyone who voted NO now realize they r being tarred with the same brush as the cunts fae George square. #goodchoice #indyref #ha

We're delighted that Scotland voted for the UK's retention. Now time to have a federal UK. #indyref

If you felt enthused by the #indyref, why not join a political party? You could represent your community as a Councillor, or an MP.

What was all that crap about #Scotland coming together no matter the result? Lots of angry threads Godwin would be proud of. #indyref

Beans on toast for brekkie so bollocks to the #indyref  all the fuckwits fighting  bitching over the result,morons the lot of you :-(

Seeing a lot of sour grapes on twitter. The vote was decisive, stop whining and move on. There's no electoral fraud conspiracy etc #indyref

#indyref was refreshing  reinvigorating for the left in Scotland - which was much needed! Lets build on it  fight establishment together.

. reported that 80% of eligible 16  17 year olds voted in the #indyref - those are compelling numbers. #lowerthevotingage

Stay constructive, Vow to make common cause with rapidly disillusioned #indyref no's. Will amount to the same!

Conservative and labour at loggerheads over Scottish devolution powers? What a surprise, just wait you'll get fuck all. #indyref

Scotland votes No, then Cameron appears to be blocking new powers.#Suckers#indyref

The #indyref poll-shock poked a stick into the hornets' nest. Out they came, and we all got stung

Really good analysis by on post #indyref landscape  via

Been obvious since before #indyref. Coverage of Gaza proved that as clearly as  lies coming out of BT mouths.

Watch live: Former PM Gordon Brown gives speech following Scottish #indyref result:

Backbench MP apparently going to tell us how we will be governed. He doesn't even have power in his own party. We have been had #indyref

I will NEVER be ashamed of being Scottish. #indyref

No so sure about this. Brown, and his impact on #indyref could well linger like Banquo's ghost whenever Miliband pops up.

Britain! Britain! Britain! Doctor Who - The Doctor's Adventures in Time  Scotland!  #indyref

Gordon Brown's pacing is making me dizzy. #indyref

#indyref Mr Brown talking now in Fife: where is our missing motion??????? #missingmotion

I genuinely didn't think I could be more disgusted with mainstream media as I have over the last 2 years. Today you prove me wrong. #indyref

Civil service already working on 'vow' pledges given to Scotland before referendum, says Gordon Brown #indyref

Mr Brown setting out new timetable? Don't you know? We don't trust Westminster politicians any more!  #missingmotion #indyref

What about the promise that a Parliamentary motion agreed between LabToryLibDems would be pubished yesterday? #indyref

Gordon Brown is a liar, a man who frightened the vulnerable  sold his country for Westminster gold: he is total scum #indyref #the45

Impressed with Gordon Browns efforts over #indyref Gamechanger? would make a good 1st Min.  Still wouldnt vote for him into WM tho.

Anyone else get the feeling that Scotland is BROWNed off with Labour? ;-) #punintended #indyref

Gordon Brown speaking in Fife this morning insists more powers for Scotland will be delivered. #indyref

How would you sum up the mood on social media since the result? #indyref

#indyref #Brown speech a MASSIVE spoiler for #Miliband #Labour Conf. He's doing the Conf. KEYNOTE  Policy timetable frae bonnie  #Scotland!

Why no powers over broadcasting? Why not allow us to keep the oil revenues and spend ourselves?Maximum devolution - having a laugh. #indyref

Good advice: Is #Britain only for the rich?  via #indyref #Scotland #UK

Everything Brown is outlining is down if achieved is down to Yes voters. It would have not happened otherwise. Is he a closet Yes  #indyref

Gordon Brown sounds like he's still campaigning! whats going on? why is he still lecturing us? #indyref

Please don't  come to our house any more. For 60 years I thought we were friends but you lied to me and stole my passport #indyref

Gordon Brown cant promise anything. Hes a backbench MP in the party of opposition. #indyref

Felt great having a government terrified of what the people might do to them, rather than the other way around. #indyref #getpolitical #tory

We must have an English parliament NOW. Scotland, Wales  N  Ireland are NOT dominions.  #federalUK #indyref #UK

The British flag to me is now like #burberry is to #chav. Can't look at it the same ever! #WeAre45 #indyref

UPDATE: 6 arrested last night during Glasgow clashes between pro-union and independence supporters #indyref

Gordon Brown centre stage act completing undermining Ed Miliband and J. Lamont leadership in post #IndyRef discussions

Scotland be proud of your country..you're back on your knees, Fear over Hope. Grow a backbone..please #indyref

The election campaign starts today as far as I'm concerned. #indyref result will drive me. #45

Needs saying often. We need to deliver the powers promised during #indyref campaign on the Brown timeline and sort out rest of UK later.

On TV again TVP Info about #indyref - my 17th appearance on this subject in two weeks. On air after 12:00 CET

'Too old for front line politics,too young for an elder statesman' but #GordonBrown  has truly come into his prime during this #indyref !

Brilliant article by 'this glorious failure could yet be Scotland's finest hour' via  #indyref

Humour and candour from Gordon Brown, the #indyref has breathed new life into his politics. But will Miliband be worried for his leadership?

how can you say you will deliver powers on a date then the day after the #indyref  turn the date down cause an election? Lier

The #indyref ballot box seals were numbered but not all numbers were recorded.

Irvine Welsh is right the Nos have simply bought time for the union. The world has changed  it is moving away from London control. #indyref

In May the Queen's speech looked a limited programme - with hindsight does it now accommodate more powers legislation post #indyref ?

#IndyRef And this is why I wonder if there should be an upper age limit on voting. Old people are just out to cause trouble ;)

Gordon Brown ensures the promise makers will not become the promise breakers #indyref

I'll be honest, if it was going to go off anywhere in Scotland after #indyref I did think might be Glasgow :( Sad to hear of flag burning.

Can Scottish Tech ride the  choppy waves?  #IndyRef #Scotland

Should  Gordon Brown resign if these #indyref pledges are not met?

I like #45 for a main one as well. Easy for people to remember and will look good on t-shirts :) #indyref

It would have been powerful to have either Alex Salmond or Nicola Sturgeon join Gordon Brown for a joint speech on unity #indyref

Hope all the Celtic supporting #NoVoters will be out congratulating the #OrangeOrder for their support in the #IndyRef today.

Drinking from my Scottish mug this morning. #indyref #unionflag

labour rejecting tory plans for more devolution smells of pre-#indyref westminster pact. just saying.

Let all England unite behind an #EnglishParliament in the North! York has my vote! #federalUK #indyref

Gordon Brown calls for Yes and No to put posters and divisions aside. Outside, these two didn't get the memo #indyref

it will be easier after the next GE he will be able 2 count SLAB MSP on one hand wearing a boxing glove #indyref

#indyref free from the responsibility I think he feels more at ease and comfortable to be himself

Heading to Glasgow this morning to gauge the vibe there w post #indyref result - will upload a blog later on

I suppose now we know that when it comes to sex, Scotland is more sub than dom. #indyref

Grieve, accept that we lost, get over it, stand up and move forward.  Phase Two is coming.#indyref

Is the #indyref result the triumph of economics (and economic anxiety) over nationality and other forms of civic attachment in the #EU?

#indyref  World/bankers relieved by Scotland result.  What was and is #Israel's position on Referendum result?

I guess our dear PM should analyze this:  #indyref #NotDemocratic

#indyref #Yes #Clan45 Labour Lords  doing the best for Scotland: BBC Scotland removed this from its news bulletins:

There is no past tense for the word 'Yes' so why should people take Gordon Brown's advice and 'throw away their Yes badges'? #indyref

And I hope the rain pours acid on the KKK, Hun tramp bastards today. #orangewalk #IndyRef

I didn't know  was Scottish! Or I really would have been stressin over #indyref

Final #indyref tweet. We must stop grouping ourselves in 'Yes' or 'No' and go back to all being Scots. We won't achieve anything otherwise.

Tough game today for it will be an #indyref and constitutional free zone for 2 hours!!

It'll take more than the #indyref to deal with tribal politics, Lab history might allow them to hang on, but who'd go LibDem over real left?

Shameful behaviour in Glasgow last night. Racist  sectarian violence using #indyref outcome as an excuse for a fight. #NotInOurName

We will never be silenced toryboy. Get used to it.#indyref

Pleasure campaigning with you for the #indyref. We've lost a battle but we'll continue to fight on for independence!#the45

An interesting piece by abt why pollsters got #indyref vote wrong while betting markets got it right:

People show up when their vote counts. There's a lesson here for Cameron, Clegg and Miliband  #indyref

So many new members of and ; the dream will never die! #scotdecides things can be better #indyref

how do you feel now NO VOTERS now that the politicians are already breaking their promises??? #indyref

It won't change. Don't waste your paper printing any more of this nonsense. #IndyRef #VoteYes

4 lessons from #indyref: 1. Civil debates. 2. Acceptance 3. Business implications 4. #bettertogether should apply for EU. #Cyprus #Spain

People came to me seeking #indyref news. They have been disappointed.

#indyref #Scotland With Scotland has died irrecoverably a piece of humanity. Now will raise the evil!

I had my #indyref party friends around me yesterday, so I'm only really dealing with the reality now, bursting my #yes balloons

Sadly many my age lived through Thatcherism  broken promises and STILL voted No, short memories. #the45 #indyref

Would love if, the morning after Glasgow violence, people could organise around hashtag less reminiscent of a sectarian bloodbath. #indyref
