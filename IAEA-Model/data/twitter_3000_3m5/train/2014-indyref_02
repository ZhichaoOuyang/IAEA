It's encouraging and inspiring seeing people of Scotland taking the time and effort to make a change for there future #indyref

#indyref If Scotland votes Yes, I know one person who I follow will explode. He can't stand Alex Salmond

It feels like a goosebumps kind of day. #VoteYes #indyref

How nice of #AndyMurray to back Scottish independence from his London home #hypicrit #indyref

When I am King you shall have some of those things, well maybe one of them. #BlairKingOfScotland #indyref

I may be by the sea but my head  heart are somewhere else #indyref

This #scottishindependence vote has got me more excited than any  election in my life, aside from the 2008 US presidential election #indyref

If Scotland votes YES then that means the rest of the UK won't have to endure another Jools Holland's Annual Hootenany. #Yes #indyref #DoIt

the Yessers of #indyref remind me of kind of political excitement that anticipated both #Obama and #Blair

Why keep banging on about what celebs think? Anyone ever made a life decision based on what David Beckham thinks? If so, stop. #IndyRef

Whichever way Scotland votes, I hope it just works out for them in the end #SeflessTweet #indyref #ScotlandDecides

It's making my eyes bleed reading Facebook and Twitter comments from English contacts on #indyref. Appalling grammar!

It's so encouraging to hear of so many no-voters deciding to vote YES now!!#indyref #YesScotland #VoteYes #yes #Scotland

Anyone else brave enough?MT On Tuesday, predicted the following #IndyRef result:NO - 57 / 56%YES - 43 / 44%

Unless the turnout is 100%, we should consider the vote null and void. #indyref Why let a tiny% of 8% decide when the other 92% cannot?

Really annoys me that people are voting no because of British Eventing and the possibility of paying two memberships #indyref

Guy I know from back home was intending to vote No until last night - a trend? #IndyRef #Yes

This is without doubt my favorite post of the day #scotland #indyref #voteyes

Is Gordon Brown showing us how big his tele is? #bigfishlittlefish #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Is it too early to start on the bevvy?My nerves are fucking frayed.#indyref #yes

Why would Scotland vote to leave a nation governed by paedophiles and their protectors? It's all the establishment's fault. #indyref

#indyref only makes me think of the Indian Jones theme tune

Remember that McDonalds ad for after Millennium? #IrnBru should be doing one for tomorrow morning #indyref

We see plenty of that in Belfast, why on earth would you vote to remain part of it? Beyond me      .#indyref YES

A massive day. Actually quite emotional going to vote. For a few secs absolute power was in your hands as you marked your X #indyref

I think we all want this to happen however who bailed the fucking Irish out? #indyref

Was getting low on stress relief. Acquired more #indyref tidy price

Hope Scotland votes Yes - for a better business environment for the digital/tech sector! #VoteYesScotland #indyref

Can I just say to those new followers I've picked up over the last few weeks due to #indyref Youre all awesome, tomorrow we'll be friends.

If the #indyref is a yes, does that mean Scottish will no longer be an accent, but a language?

GO OUT AND WIN AND WIN FOR SCOTLAND #VoteNo #indyref

Sick of vile from both camps in #indyref by all means debate but don't abuse others for not agreeing with you

#indyref the outcome of a vote depends on how the question is framed. This is why Australia votes NO some years ago

Remember that time the guy came to Donegal from Edinburgh and couldn't understand the Glasgow accents? #indyref #indieref

The negative and the positive, side by side at Cramond Primary polling station EDI.. #indyref

- Have you seen out #indyref video

Just went and done my bit #indyref

We have seen it, through history, through our lives, globally. Kids have not seen. They do not know. #indyref #voteno #Salmond

Why is the pro #indyref campaign called the 'yes' campaign instead of the 'aye' campaign? #Scotland

How about calling a General Election so that those of us in rUK can have a say? #indyref #yes

Survive or perish the union has had to prove its worth. So will the church   #indyref #christian

As a child of divorced parents, I really hope Scotland and GB stay together for the kids #sticktogether #indyref #ScotlandDecides

So are we finding out each individual areas results as they are declared or are they waiting until all votes have been counted? #indyref

or is it scary that 96-year-old will decide the future of that 16-year-old ? #indyref

I just voted Yes. I've done some drugs in my time  but that was the greatest high I've ever had. #indyref #VoteYesScotland

Very disappointed at some so-called 'Christian' 'American' 'Conservatives' tweeting about #IndyRef. You're clueless. We don't care/need you.

I am a Scot, who has lived in England for the last 30+ years. What would I vote - if I had a vote? #nothanks #indyref

thanks for providing the best, well, the most entertaining, #indyref coverage.

I can't imagine what it must be like to go into the #indyref poll station as an undecided - i'd be sick i think!

It's definitely not boring in front of the Scottish parliament. #indyref

My wee hoose! (There's 2 more at the back!)  #indyref #yes

One good thing about being in the US is that most of the results will be out before bedtime tonight. #indyref

After rolling coverage for years,any polling day is always eerily quiet media wise due to the law preventing any campaign coverage #indyref

we've all had our journey to make but as long as we get there.  #VoteYes #indyref

Encroaching on only 8 hours left to vote get out there and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands #indyref #VoteYes

With 50 minutes to go until polls close, see who is tweeting about yes or no in #indyref until 16.00 today

But why embarrass yourself; vote yes instead.#YES #scottishindependence #indyref

Ignore the bookies  others claiming a No victory- just make sure you and all like-minded friends and family have voted #Yes by 10.#indyref

Less than an hour left to cast your vote, then join us as we bring you updates from the count in Haddington as #ELdecides #indyref

Reports of postal voting turnout in #indyref very high. Areas like Orkney (holiday destination earlier this year for me) relying on it.

If Scotland votes for independence, who takes the blame for Paul McCartney's Mull of Kintyre? #indyref

U took the words right out my mouth. Ignore the intimidation, ignore the propaganda. VOTE YES #indyref #VoteYes

Less than a hour! Squeaky bum time! #indyref

#indyref: 'Scotland will find few friends and allies in Europe'

Are exit polls that expensive? I'm sure if the BBC had organised a quick whip-round political junkies would have chipped in for one #indyref

It's wonderful to know that no matter what the #indyref result Tories don't have a hope of winning the next election. And Cameron is screwed

Is it me or is Gordon Strachan extra-Scottish tonight #EuropaLeague #indyref #ScotlandDecides #stupidscot #ginger #ITV4

Yes campaigners gather in #Glasgow with less then an hour before the polls close #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Proud to be Glaswegian #indyref  Wish I was there tonight!

Many seem to be ignoring these issues which is a selfish, me, me , me  type attitude #indyref #BetterTogether

Actually so nervous and excited about the outcome #VoteYes #indyref

stick to the football pal - they're wax pencils so they can't be rubbed out. Good luck at the weekend #Hibs #indyref

If I go to sleep early, will independence come quicker? #indyref

Showing my support for #indyref in blue today!

What if one side wins the popular vote in the #indyref but the other becomes reality? I'm sure that's happened before #BushvGore

This is a pressing issue. Very little discussion about who will actually govern an independent Scotland. #indyref #worrying

A few thoughts on today's vote, in case you missed it earlier  #scotlanddecides #indyref

Ooh which channel will have the best coverage tonight for #indyref results. Currently flicking through channels!

Truly amazing. Polling stations closing because of 100% turnout! #indyref

Will they tell us to look away when the results go up for the #indyref so it doesnt spoil it for the ones who want to get them later

Hope I don't wake up tomorrow to find my country split in two. The UK isn't perfect, but it's better to fix it than abandon it #indyref

Scotland. Land of the free roaming Japanese tourists. #indyref

Gonna be so scared to wake up tomorrow #indyref

Anyone on here in George Square? Webcam shot makes it look pretty busy. #indyref

Independent Scotland will be governed by an elected government. It's not that complicated. #indyref

With 45 mins left to go still no answers on the role of a Jamiroquai union. Unacceptable #bettertogether #indyref

passing #indyref will force scotland to return to a barter system. but they will be sheepionaires #USAIndyRefAMA

Mrs F gets some customers for her industrial supply of chilli con carne. #indyref #YES #nowtocount

The biggest barrier to #indyref arguments in a pub is needing a piss.

Scots should vote every other week, just because it's so cool to see them walk to the polling places. #indyref

Voted yes a week ago. A nervous sleepless night ahead. #indyref

Extended family up from England hoping for Yes. They've hired a tartan camper-van. I hope we don't disappoint them #indyref

40 minutes to go until the #indyref voting slams shut. 40 minutes until no one can change a thing. Scotland either stays or goes *gulp*

Beer, check. Vodka, check. Mixer, check. Chip+dip, check. Mon then Scotland, lets be having you! #indyref #drinkresponsibly

Dropped son John of at Ingliston to help at the big count tonight #indyref

You'll never guess where most of the 'No' tweets are from  #IndyRef

To stay or to go? How Scottish independence would actually work:  #indyref

If it's No then has a lot to thank for if it's a #Yes then he only has himself to blame #Indyref

Just went to put a bet on #indyref yes vote, seems WilliamHill are backing Scotland

Two things: 1) people shouldn't get emotional about #IndyRef. It's the Scots' decision. I'd vote for Manchester getting it's independence.

The Scottish referendum: what happens immediately after the polls close  #indyref

Here's an idea: regardless of result we set the next referendum for 10 years time. That should keep the politicians honest #indyref #FB

Seems you really got upset. As I do not like the ethnic nationalist thing I suggest we quit. #indyref

I would rather this wasn't the last bit of actual democracy Scotland sees for a long time. Please, #VoteYes Let's have a say. #indyref

#VoteYesScotland trending very highly on twitter tonight. Better indication of intention than the opinion polls? #indyref

For my birthday (tomorrow), I'd like Scotland to stay in the UK. I'd also like wine. #indyref #winemakesitbetter

Huge admiration for Scottish passion, I hope that when the dust settles there's no bad feelings. Wonderful place  people #indyref

The eyes of the world are on Scotland, hope over fear, we can break the chains of the established elite, Be born again Scotland #indyref

Gwan Scotland - 34 minutes left to get into that queue. Get your vote on, you good thing! #indyref

Dear Americans, Scotland is having a referendum. I'm glad you care, but please stop calling it an election. #indyref

#YES - This could be #Scotland in just a few years -  #independent #Ireland! Then again, you could vote #No. #indyRef

Remember we are one Scotland. No winners, no losers. #ScotlandDecides #indyref #OneScotland #democracy #votingpower

you misunderstand a vote No is as much a vote for something as a vote yes is inspiration is in the vote #indyref

Tonight Scotland makes a huge decision. How lucky we are to be able to vote without violence or intimidation. Today I am proud. #indyref

What do these adorable kids in Glasgow think about the #indyref?

It's awesome to see so many people voting in the #indyref today. Hearing reports of nearly 90% turn out!

I know. A desire to run your own affairs is terribly selfish. Whatever happened to good old British altruism? #indyref #scotland

My eldest travelled FOUR hours from Dundee to put that X in the #YES box! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

The Guardian #indyref live blog team have been on point all day, and still going strong:

Excellent call by ITV to take  coverage of historic election through the night. It's Scotland's night ! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Have this from the good people of Owens Illinois. Seems appropriate tonight #indyref #Scotland

To say I'm nervous about the #indyref would be an understatement.

Many reasons to dislike the SNP, but one that developed today was that I have to get up at 5am tomorrow to cover the #indyref. Cheers, guys.

What I saw down at Holyrood today #indyref #nothanks

I have everything crossed for you, including my wonky toes! #indyref #indyrefallnighter

97% registered,  80% turnout, #indyref an almost perfect example of democracy. If only we'd had balanced and intelligent argument.

THANK YOU you've both been my news feed for last couple months #passion #truths #scotland #votedyes #indyref

Interested to see the result of the #indyref tomorrow, if it's a yes I can see a Welsh referendum on the cards

Let's face it. Regardless of the outcome, we're all waking up to a new Britain tomorrow. #indyref

If the tweets suggesting 87% #indyref turnout in some areas are correct I am straight to lumping money on yes!

No voters more incentivized to turn out. Worst case for a Yes voter is status quo. #psychology #indyref

At #indyref in Edinburgh Look who we found moonlighting for STV. with me and

Scottish Nationalist party..sounds similar to the National Socialist German Workers Party to me. What could possibly go wrong #indyref

20 minutes left for the Union? Or 20 mins to greater devolution inc for England ? We will wake to an interesting day tmw #history #IndyRef

To look at #indyref sentiment on its own on Twitter, hard not to feel that #ScotlandIndependence is about to become a reality.

We may need a lot of these cards in the morning! #indyref #Scotland

you have played a blinder. Thank you for all your efforts.It is going to be a long night.#indyref

They would flip a coin but they can't decide which currency to use. #indyref

That's it, polls closed, a nation's fate decided. In for a sleepless night. Considering sleeping on the sofa -with a v stiff drink.#indyref

Most of us Scots are deciding on #indyref whilst I am deciding on which JPS or Nova

you have been a credit and have shone. #indyref has had winners and losers and your gracious manner one of the main winners

As the #indyref is broadcast globally the Returning Officer needs to do her party piece (whatever that is) n get her place in History

Seeing a lot of 'No' result and prediction tweets in my timeline. Hmm. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Bollocks, they'd have wanted the #indyref even if Labour had stayed in! is less popular than Cameron in Scotland!

I'm so excited about the #indyref vote. Thing is, I'm in Scotland next week. Hope I'm made welcome.

I wonder if #westminsterbubble will learn lessons from #indyref? Or just go back to its hubristic insularity?

What going to be a bit depressing about the vote result is that either way it's a country divided. #indyref
