If I was Van Marwijk, I wouldn't bring RVP off, Id have both him and KJH up front. See if the Danes could handle that! #Euro2012

Denmark came into Euros with something to prove and they're doing just that right now #Euro2012

Football evening in Euro 2012 Fanzone, Warsaw #euro2012 #euro12gr

Great relaxing morning watching Euro 2012 #euro2012 #lazysaturdays #chillen

so basically Ferdinand is too good to go to euro 2012 ..what a load of twaddle #england #euro2012

People!!! Didn't I say the euros will be totally unpredictable??!! Looks like Holland may loose #Daayyuum #Euro2012

I put RVP in my Euro dream team expecting him to score! Bad decision should have picked Welbeck at least he might hit the target! #Euro2012

If the world real ends this year #2012 does this is means that dc z the last #Europe Competition? No more #Euros #Euro2012

the Danish defence have been epic especially agger if they can see this through result of the euros so far #Euro2012

Euro 2012 won't start till Germany kicks off. Let's win this title. #germany #euro2012 #realfootball

Holland going all out with those changes.  Let's see what happens #euro2012 #Euro

The Danes have been well drilled there organisation is class the euros have started with a bang #impressed #Euro2012

it reminds me of watching all last season lol #euro2012 #euros

The only problem with #EURO2012 is that there are almost NO BEARDS! C'mon guys, grow a beard! #beardcountry #eurobeard #euro

van Bommel kops a booking for leathering someone - THE EUROS HAVE BEGUN!! #Euro2012

Sneijder even! (too many odd names 2 try n spell in the Euros!) #Euro2012

and 2 mediocre players hammering players at the euros! It is hilarious!! #euro2012

Snejider has had pass and nearly assist of the Euros and it's only the second day! #Euro2012

85 Goals between Van Persie and Hunterlaar this season and they can't even score one yet at the Euro's smh #Euro2012

If the Dutch lose this match, the much anticipated side to win the euro could be exiting  at group stages #Euro2012

If #Holland finish this game empty handed, they're out of the EUROs. It's that simple! #HollandVsDenmark #Euro2012

Wish I was playing in the Euros, that pitch looks class. Also having that many people watching you, must be maaaaad #Euro2012

You can have 11 of the best players in the world, ide rather have 11 players that know how to be a team! #WellDoneDenmark #Euro2012

Holland will still win the Euros i think. #Euro2012

Russia vs Czech Republic 4-1 All Goals  Highlights | Euro 2012 | -  #euro2012

Denmark flying the flag for Charlton at the euros #cafc #Euro2012

Robben is such a big game player. World Cup final, CL Final and Euros now. So clutch. #YeahRight #Euro2012

If #Holland lose, I bet that will mess up some accumulators! #gutted #Euro2012 #Euros #EuroPredictions #Euro12

My team for Euro.. Portugal XI: Patricio, Pereira, Pepe, Alves, Coentrao, Veloso, Moutinho, Meireles, Postiga, Nani, Ronaldo. #euro2012

I am not having any luck betting on the euro's! #euro2012

Jonathan Pearce asking Martin Keown for his expert knowledge of what it feels like to lose Euro championship matches! #euro2012

3 of the 6 goals allowed by Denmark in Euro qualifying came in the final 15 minutes. #Euro2012

Heading to the first upset of Euro 2012 Dutch are panicking #euro2012

HORRIFIC start to my Euro - I know nothing! #Euro2012

Spain got beat in there first game in the World Cup and then went on to win it Holland could do the same in the Euro's #Euro2012

OK, I take back that the Netherlands will win the Euro's. not looking good for them #Euro2012

Give me a re-tweet if you're watching Euro 2012 and trying to tweet at the same time - bloody difficult #euro2012 #bbcfootball

Denmark to beat Netherlands! First shock of the euro's if they do..they're defending just as well as I do on FIFA!#euro2012

Not impressed with the dutch at all! Major hype big players fail to impress AGAIN! Ronaldo to score first next game handy 60 euro #EURO2012

hopefully no one will want van persie after the euros and then he can stay :) #Arsenal #Euro2012

90mins up, 3mins added time can the Dutch redeem themselves now? #Euro2012 Euro

Neither of the top scorers from EURO qualifying start for their respective countries - Huntelaar (12) and Klose (9) #euro2012

watching netherlands lose to denmark.. first upset in the euro, #euro2012

Denmark are motivated by their historical Euro success #EURO1984  #EURO2012

This euro tournament so far  has been insane, hope it can all be this good #Euro2012

#ned should have had a penalty #Euros i was hoping #euro2012 wouldnt be contraversial

And the Danes pull off a shocker. Their first ever victory in their opening game of the Euro Cup.#Euro2012 #NetherlandsVsDenmark

I see UEFA have hand picked the very best referees for this tournament. #Euro2012 #Euros #EuroTekkers

Thats Holland out of the Euro's for me! #Euro2012

As I forecast from my Euro Lake: Van Perchie + Van Barbel + Van Der Eel = VAN HOME. #bbcfootball #euro2012

And that's the 1st shock of the euros. It had to be the team Robbern plays for #euro2012

Who thought the first clean sheet in Euro 2012 would be the Danes against Holland #StrangeTounamentSoFar #Euro2012

Looks the Dutch will be another let down in the euros again #euro2012

First sensation of the Euro! My second pick is looking pretty bad.. #Euro2012

Holy Denmark Batman! First opening round win ever in euro championship #Euro2012 #Holland #Denmark

A disciplined Danish performance leads to the first shock of EURO 2012! Holland 0 -1 Denmark! #euro2012

So Holland are the only team so far not to score in the Euros #Euro2012

This is why I love the Euros Denmark upsetting Holland #GroupOfDeath #euro2012

Wow! Denmark has beaten the Netherlands in tonight's first Euro game! Now for Game 2 #Euro2012

Well done #Denmark and well done to #LFC man Daniel Agger #euro2012 #euros

I can see agger lifting the euro trophy now   #denmark #Euro2012

Danes Beat the Dutch 1-0 in Euro 2012 #EURO2012, coming up Germany vrs Portugal

Netherlands won Euro 88 after losing 1st game and will need to do it again. Great result for Denmark 1-0 winners. #Euro2012

And just before the Holland game I put a tenner on Holland to win the euros..hmm maybe it was a bad choice #Euro2012 #justmyluck

#EURO2012 Loss of the Netherlands first surprises euro 2012 !!!

The refereeing at the Euros so far has been awful. No excuses for the majority of the decisions. #Euro2012

Euro 2012 keeps giving!!! Unexpected win for the Danes!!!! #euro2012 #Denmark

Euro 2012 has just taken it's first Scalp with the Much fancied Dutch team loosing to the Danes!#euro2012 #ssfootball

Holland Are Held To A 1-0 Defeat To Euro 92 Shock Winners Denmark In The Opening Group B Match #Euro2012

#Euro2012 Germany have the youngest squad of the Euro(24 years and 358 days). Their previous two youngest squads WON the Euro(1972 and 1980)

Well that's the shock of the euro's so far. Denmark manage to hold onto their 1 goal advantage. The dutch had 28 SOG! #Euro2012

gotta love the upsets! thats what makes the euros so exciting ! #Euro2012 #Denmark

finished betting on betting #euro2012 - only hope now is my France to win euros bet

The Dutch need a superhero for the Euros: Ryan Babel. #Euro2012

Said that it wouldn't be an easy game for Holland. No game will be easy at the Euros. Fair play to Denmark #euro2012

First shock of the euro's. Sure there'll plenty more. Welldone Denmark. #euro2012

Holland lost to Denmark haaaaaaaaaaaa! Spain/Italy to win the Euro's.. I stick by my prediction! Spain for me of course! ;) #Euro2012

only good thing about #EURO2012 euro is that it dilutes the mlb coverage when I watch sport highlights

The 1st shock in #EURO2012 #Denmark this Euro will be full of surprises ;-)

My tenner on holland to win the euros is looking a bit daft now #euro2012

Buffon: Spain are the best team in Euro 2012  #Euro2012 #football

I think Spain or Germany will win the euros #Euro2012

What a shock result. Netherland lost to denmark. Euro just begins, too early to predict who is going to the knockout stages. #Euro2012

Enjoying the Euros, but annoyed at how ridiculous the fan parks are. How do you fuck that up? #euro2012

Well, with this stupid play Netherlands out of euro battle #Euro2012

First it was Poland, then Czech and now Holland. The wonders of Euro 2012 is getting better #Euro2012

You can bet all my tweets will be about soccer while the #Euros are on #nothingbetter #EURO2012

#Euro2012 Holland doing the oposite of Euro 2008. Amazing to poor now poor to amazing?

Euros 8 goals two red cards 3 controversy decisions and a huge upset. I'm in love #Euro2012

Statto: When Holland won Euro 88 they lost their 1st group game #EURO2012

Denmark have still never lost a EURO game when scoring first. 6 wins now, 4 draws. #stat #euro2012

Well there go's all my bets fuck the euros not watching it anymore! Well until I next go to #ladbrokes #Euro2012

Van Persie scores when he wants. Someone make him want to score at the Euros. #euro2012

Netherlands have now lost 3 of their 9 Euro opening matches. Last time in 1988 0-1 v USSR the Dutch went on to win European title #euro2012

Spain asking for help of the #EMF. Will the #Euro fail during #Euro2012?

Holland 0-1 Denmark. I imagine that will put a smile on a lot of peoples faces. This Euro has been class aleady !!! #Euro2012

1988 the Dutch lost their first match and went on to win the Euros. Shit load of possession, just no luck in front of goal. #Euro2012

Now a Portugal win would create  new euro crisis for Germany #euro2012

FT: NED 0-1 DEN Shock win for the Danes. Just three matches in, this Euro looks to be the most entertaining one yet #EURO2012

I hate #Ronaldo, but he is so much fun to watch. Germany to take the EURO though, so can suck a fat dick. #euro2012

After watching the dutch game I could quite happily not watch another game of the euros #Euro2012 #boring

Andcan the Euro's get any better?  #Euro2012

Holland won the Euros in 1988 after losing their first game, so maybe history will repeat itself ? Hope so. #Euro2012

Denmark are now favourites to win euro 2012 #EURO2012

with Germany winning 3-2 in Euro 2008, Portugal winning 3-0 in Euro 2000 and the sides drawing 0-0 at Euro 1984. #Euro2012

Checked my Euro bracket - don't have either Holland or Denmark going through. Guess I am rooting for a draw in Germany-Portugal. #euro2012

Euro 2012 FT: Netherlands 0 - 1 Denmark. 1st upset of Euro. Krohn-Dehli d hero. Den beat Ned since 1967. D Dutch were boring. #euro2012 #fb

#Denmark gets 1st win in 7 EURO openers, beats #TheDutch for 1st time since 1967 ('92 semi ws draw)#Euro2012 #Dutch deservd 2 penalties ;-(

It's sports heaven right now - French Open, US Open, Euro, NHL finals and the Olympics looming. Great win Denmark! #Euro2012

I never expected #holland to be much good in the euros. They have no defence and their midfield is too old and slow #Euro2012

Got Netherlands in the Euro draw in work.. not off to a good start so far #Euro2012

Wasn't looking forward to the Euro's at all but I've enjoyed every game so far #euro2012

The last time Germany won a trophy. 16yrs ago. Euro '96. #Euro2012

Enjoying the Euro feel sorry for missus like #euro2012

Cristiano Ronaldo may give Portugal the edge in today's second Euro match, but I still believe Germany will win. A draw maybe? #EURO2012

The best thing about the euros so far is the outstanding camera work that has bought us so many amazing women to our tv's #Euro2012

Took a risk on kjaer and eriksson in euro dream team looks to have payed off #euro2012

Wonder if this Euro's will be known for its resilient defences as opposed to its creative attacking play? #Euro2012

Check Germany's record for the past 12 years, both Euro and World Cup. They do very well, they just don't win it. #Euro2012

Spain are gonna win te Euro's with ease !! They don't need a striker, there midfield will dominate #euro2012 #football

Wish the #tennis werent on at the same time does the Euros. #frenchopen #euro2012

If Germany make the Final of #Euro2012 they will have appeared in 50% of the Euro Championship Finals

I'm watching Euro 2012 on STV.  come on italy and supermiro #Euro2012

I don't think Spain will win the euro, no power upfront, not the team they were #euro2012

Anyone know the Croatia starting line up? #euro2012 #euros #Croatia #Betting #Gambling

yeah! Spain will beat Italy to win Euro Cup. Aftrall Thr's more aggression in the team whose economy is in a deeper mess. #euro2012

I finally get to sit back and relax with a can of beer and watch the Euros. What a shit match this is. #euro2012

Anyone else think Spain wont win euro's playing with no out and out striker. Barca get away with it cause they have Messi #Euro2012

#ITA #ESP has potential if the Italians don't play too defensively. Euro 08 meeting ended in 0-0 draw. #Euro2012

I would say this is the best game I've watched so far at the euros the passing is excellent #italy #spain #euro2012 #motta #ballotelli

According to Opta, Spain start for the first time in their history without a recognized normal striker at a Euro fina

Would love it if the quality of itv player on my iPad was better, trying to watch the euros #Euro2012

The Euro's come every 4 years fuck revision #Euro2012

Methinks Pirlo may well have played in the very first Euros ever #euro2012

woopty Fucking doo. Spain are world and Euro champions, I'd say they are doing it right. #euro2012

Torres should be on. Him in the last Euro's. Phenomenal. #Euro2012

Just saying now I think Italy are going to win the euros. #Euro2012 #ItalyToWin

Italy haven't scored a free-kick at the Euros in 44 years; with the last one being against Yugoslavia in 1968.  #euro2012

Iniesta was the most creative player in the Euro qualifiers, setting up a chance for ESP every 18 minutes #euro2012

So, who has been watching the Euro's so far? #Euro2012

From the highlights I saw of Bra v Arg game yesterday, the game makes the Euro matches so far look like the Ryman League. #euro2012

I genuinely believe the reason spain are playing without stickers is because nobody put either of them in their fantasy euro teams #Euro2012

The #Euro2012 ball is too normal. It isn't a true Euro until there's some sort of ball controversy #ballsandall

No striker in the first game of the Euro championships, what's going on Spain #Euro2012

my mom wont let me watch a full fucking euro game without making me do some shit for her like leave me alone its #euro2012

This flower/ball thingy that keeps coming up for every stupid replay is ANNOYING #Euro2012 #ITV Euro spain italy

The italian team has got the best hair of all Euro 2012 #Euro2012

Got the euro recorded and going for a hike with the family. Go Spain! #euro2012

Not sure if Spain or Germany are gunna win the Euros.If Spain's manger is relying on these 6 midfielders to finish he got no hope. #euro2012

Correction Euro Cup #Euro2012, when is the World Cup?

is it me or is that pitch looking really poor for a euro match #euro2012

I have never known a team not play a striker in the euros. #couldbeastat #Euro2012 #ITVFOOTBALL

Spain's passing/possession game is incredible to watch. Football at its finest. Definitely a favourite to win the Euro again. #Euro2012

The euro cameramen really enjoy zooming in on fit birds #Euro2012 must be #LADS

Spain should bring the two Fernandos on #Euro2012 #euros

Greece Euro winners 2004Spain Euro winners 2008..Now both bankrupt. Let's hope Germany wins this one! #Euro2012

Before the Euros all the pundits were bleating on about teams with strong attacking options  weak defences. Shows what they know. #euro2012

#Italy are the only side #Spain have played more than 4 times at Euros  World Cups but never beaten in regular time

Id this the group of death - bored yo death! #euro2012

Look at Henry at Euro 2000 (age:22), he was brilliant. Balo is 21 now, his he worth the fuss? We'll see. #euro2012

If Ballotelli keeps his head, Italy could take this. #Euro2012 #Euro #EuroPredictions

From What Ive Seen Of The Euros So Far It's Been Toss #NoGoals #Euro2012

Id argue Italy were the better team there, Spain need llorente on to bash a few in. De Rossi is a mighty fine makeshift defender #euro2012

How do you feel if your Fernando Torres and no strikers on the pitch is being preferred to you?? #euros #euro2012 #euros2012

The first 45 of the Italy-Spain game has been the best of the Euros so far. Both teams getting good chances. #euro2012

Most entertaining game so far this Euro! There will be goals in the second half for sure. Torres has to come on very soon. #euro2012

Spain not looking like the team that won the WC or previous Euro Champs in that 1st half cuz. #Euro2012

in all fairness I didn't see that one coming it could be another euro 2004 just crazy #Euro2012

Fuck, what id kill to watch the #EURO2012 things we do for ma medie, really!!

Goals, goals, goals - although not in this year's Euro 2012 apparently. #euro2012

sorry guys for my noise :D i have a deep passion for italy's football squad, since euro 2000  #ESPvITA #Euro2012

Said it in the Euro 2008, said it again in the FIFA World Cup 2010. #Euro2012 is no different.. Spain Champions.!!

Spain are fully mocking the whole meaning of formation I love it !! #EURO2012 Split screen euros and French open

Alexi Lalas should get off #ESPN and spend more time reading football history instead. He doesn't get the Euro mentality at all #Euro2012

England plays in the Euro's tomorrow, hopefully my mom called my school already and told them I won't be there #Euro2012

RT Winner of today's game gets a Euro bail out. #Euro2012 -- witty

I think that 45 minutes has taught us that Torres on the pitch id better than no strikers #EURO2012 #ZzZzZzZzZz

Best thing about the Euros? Singing along to Peter and the Wolf #Euro2012 #annoyinggirlfriend

Messi is Argentinian, not Spanish. He's not gonna play at the Euros so stop fucking talking about him!! #Euro2012 #SpavsIta

Due to the #euro crisis, #Germany will get half of #Spain, #Ireland, #Greece and #Portugal's goals for the next 6 tournam

No one expects anything from Ireland at #Euro2012. Same was said of Denmark at Euro 92 and against Holland yesterday.

Antonio Di Natale (in) - Mario Balotelli (out) (Italy) - From the official UEFA EURO 2012 app with Orange  #Euro2012

balotelli just lost u ur 10 euro #Euro2012 #awkward

Don't care if you've won last Euro Champs  World Cup Still gotta play a central striker!! #Euro2012 #ESP

Finally able to watch at least a little bit of this euro cup!! Spain vs. Italy! #euro2012

Di Natale won't have great memories of facing Spain. The striker saw a penalty saved in the shootout at Euro 2008 by Iker

All the big games in euros so far have been shy of goals for some of best strikers in the world #euro2012

Blanc insists France are not favourites in their Euro group ahead of England match  #Euro2012 #football

Come on Croatia great chance to start the Euro off with a win.It will make my day. #Euro2012 #comeoncroatia #malovasje

#DiNatale sticks one in the onion bag, #Italy 1-0 #Spain#ITA #ESP #Euro2012 #Euros

Di Natale!!! I knew spains tactics would bite them in the arse!! Playing no striker will not win you the Euros #euro2012

Telling you germany are going to win the Euros! Only big team to perform at the moment #Euro2012

Spain have got a penalty.1 billion Euro's for going overdrawn. #Euro2012

Gone for my usual outside bet on the Euros.Croatia to win the tournament 50-1.Jalevic to get golden boot 40-1.Worth a double? #euro2012

And that, everyone else, is why Spain are reigning world and euro champions.  #euro2012

This is why I love the euros they are much better than the world cup#Euro2012

So that is one statistic dead. Spain scores against Italy in the Euros. #Euro2012

Too many penalties that should have been given this Euros! I count 5 already this Tournament #Euro2012

Ireland a victim of weak refereeing which has been a trend of these Euro Championship's. Let's hope it doesn't happen tomorrow. #Euro2012

England!  will win the Euros, then the WC always said Hodgson better than Redknapp. Best since 1966 Lescott brilli..FUCK! #Euro2012

This is reminding me of Euro '88. Not the football - Joe Hart's awful tips. #Euro2012

The big diff. B/w afcon and euro cup is the class Nasri dat was indee CLASSIC #Euro2012

We are watching without doubt the best match in the Euro so far. #Euro2012

Live Euro 2012: England, France level at 1-1 at half-time #euro2012

These ESPN commentators seem to know a lot about English football. About the French, not so much. #EURO2012 #Euro #ENGvFRA

When people are suddenly the biggest soccer fans when the Euro or World Cup is on   #soccerproblems #euro2012

Id take that 1-1 at HT, but we cant sit back so much,shut them down more and get in behind them,down middle or from the wings #Euro2012

These refs are a load of wank. In every game this euros they have been making shit decision's #Euro2012

How bad have the refs been so far in the euros! #euro2012

Why are euros and world cups always marred with poor refereeing? #Euro2012

So half the England squad were in front of the goal and France still scored. Maybe we should join the Euro after all #Euro2012

There has been some terrible refereeing in the euros #euro2012

How many Euros has Blanc given this ref? Worst ref of the tournament so far #Euro2012

Making my cat my boyfriend since this fucking euro is on #Euro2012

A mate just txt me saying the ref's been paid, he can't have the French are skint they have no Euro's #England #Euro2012 #EnglandFrance

Fat french man asleep at euro's ahah asif! Who goes to the euro's and falls asleep seriously! #EURO2012

20 years ago in Euro 1992, France and England came in the bottom of the table, falling victim to Sweden and shock-winners Denmark. #EURO2012

If this pub had a swear jar, we'd solve the Euro-zone crises #Euro2012 #EnglandVFrance

Oh shit Gerard's Hollywood's passes are out. Lescott/Terry watch out #Euro2012 #Euros #England

Its nice to see that uefa have given job opportunities to the blind at the euros, these linesman cant see shit. #Euro2012 #ComeOnEngland

Watching the euro's in a coat, so much for a British summer #Euro2012 #England #Britishsummertime

No herd a decent atmosphere at the euros yet #Euro2012

Oxlade-Chamberlain is well out of his depth at this level. #Euro2012 #Euros

Looks like Scott Parker is absolutely spent although I think that id rather have a knackered Parker than a fresh Henderson. #euro2012

The ref is a fucking joke. How the fuck did he get a game in euros. #Euro2012 #England

Two yellows for England amp; none for France..can someone get a note to the ref it's Euro 2012, not Eurovision #euro2012 #england

Like watching Eurovision song contest!! Getting nothing in euro!! #Euro2012

I'm sick of England and English teams getting bullshit decisions from referees at Euros and World cups! #fuming #Euro2012 #ComeOnEngland

Roy Hodgson is a brave man. Firstly for bringing Henderson to the Euros and secondly, taking of Scott Parker for him#Euro2012

This ref is a joke. I get the feeling he's angry at us for not been in the euro zone #euro2012 #bbcsport #England

Watching the euro cup to check out the hotties, I'll take Jordan Henderson 8 please #England #Euro2012

Roy hodgson is an idiot it always should've been harry reddnapp #Euro2012 #England #BBCSport #ITVFootball #EURO

With Inji , Ish and at Muah Crib. Euro Fever . :D #Euro2012

Feels a bit like the Euro 2004 opener. I really hope there isn't a French winner around the corner! #Euro2012

Is this ref worthy for the euros! He should be reffing Sunday football! #Euro2012

Newcastle are soo lucky to get Cabaye before these Euros started #Euro2012

Can this euro game get a little more exciting? Please #EURO2012

Like d Euro economy, d Euro 2012 also seems to be gng at slow boring pace!! #euro2012

The referee clearly saying to the england players.your not in thr euro so im not giving you anything #euro2012

I'm glad the Euros is a comp. For the ref's too cos this one ain't getting very far. #franceengland #Euro2012

Oh you want me to come out.Euro's on #couchpotato #Euro2012

Euro 96 Gazza wore number 8. Now Henderson wears it at #euro2012. Perfect example of the decline in English football

Wow I think that ref will no longer be involved in the euros anymore #euro2012

French cheated their way into the world cup now cheating there way through the Euros.Platini fixing the gameit's obvious#Euro2012

Wonder how many euros the French bunged the Italian ref? #euro2012

This referee is takin the fkin piss man!!!!! Get the cunt sacked am foaming #euro2012 #england #france #3lions #eng #euros

See thw only bad thing about the euros is have to listen to english commentators slaver a load of pish ! #euro2012

UFEA need to sort the level of refs at the euros been shocking so far #Euro2012

using the hash tag #Euro2012 isn't boycotting the Euros.

If England wins anyone want to join me chanting ole ole ole in front of the French consulate??? No? Zit alors!!!#England #Euro2012 #EURO

I have this horrible feeling I'm going to see a repeat of the game at Euro 2004. #lastminutefrenchwinner #Euro2012

Infact put me in a room wif Ribery and the Ref and give me a taser gun id teach the french cunts !!! #Euro2012

This Italian referee needs to start refereeing the game and stop trying to get a result that will benefit the euro zone the most. #Euro2012

So frank's not playing so I've decided that my new piece of eye candy for the euros is cabaye #phwoar #Euro2012

As poor as many PL referees are, the refs at these Euros are making them look positively omniscient  #Euro2012

Hating the Euros man shitty 1-1 draws! #StepItUp #Euro2012 #Coupenbursters

Id have brough Carroll on personally like, think big andy would give rami n mexes an torrid time, We have no presence up top #Euro2012

Watching this Euro match is just like watching the Saddlers  (awful refereeing)  #ENG #FRA #Euro2012 #itvsport

Cabaye I've decided is my favourite player at the euros! #Euro2012 #NUFC

NASRI- the only PL player to appear in Euro 2012 AND JEremy Kyle (thanks #Euro2012

This euro cup is wide open. A lot of sleepers. Watch out for Russia and Croatia. #Euro2012

RT #Euro2012 - 2 players from Manchester City have scored in a single match at Euro or World Cup for the first time ever. s

In Euro 2004 scores were level at this stage before Zidane Penalty in 94th minute gave France the win #euro2012

Euro 2012 ResultFrance 1-1 England FT(Lescott  Nasri)#Euro2012 #England #france #engvsfra

FT: France 1:1 England. After the 1. half I thought it could get good but it ended up being the worst match of EURO yet. #EURO2012 #FRAENG

EURO 2012 UPDATE Final Time England 1:1 France  #EURO2012 #England Vs France

Too many tied games in this euro. #Euro2012

All of the the big countries in the euro's have a been a let down.. #Boringgames #Euro2012

But I still want Germany to win the euros #Euro2012

Ashley Cole is a beast of a defender. The French did not engineer any moves down his flank #3Lions #Euros #Euro2012

Yet another draw in the Euro 2012! England 1 - 1 France another update. #Euro2012

projected score like draw (1-1) always ruins the real fun of game ..its becoming a common symptom in euro league #euro2012

That might just have been the most boring half of football of the Euros #football #Euro2012

that awkward moment between the euro games..#BORED #euro2012

Decent result but England have to start shooting instead of fannying around up front   #Euro2012 #Euros

My French colonial master that was only an opening game, by the powers bestowed upon me you will conquer the euro cup FOR FRANCE #euro2012

still OK given the overall start of the Euro so far. nothing is set in stone just yet. #France #euro2012

Decent start to Euro 2012 for England tbh I think Rooney would of made a big difference if he played! #MUFC #England #Euro2012

Now for a goal fest, a huge 3-2 game Ukraine vs Sweden !! I'm thinking lots of goals!! We need to see Euro goals!! #Euro2012

Another good game in Euro 2012 . #England #France #Euro2012 . Best player Diarra IMO

England is the most boring team at Euro's so far #Euro2012 #SSfootbal

Good start 2 our euro campaign things can only get better ! #euro2012 #MightyStevieG

Well done England nice start to the euros #Euro2012

It sickens, disgusts and angers me on so many levels that that awful multi-national corporation sponsors the Euros. Appalling. #euro2012

Best thing is, we've already started better than at Euro 2004 #Euro2012

#england #euro2012 #uefa #euro - General Sports News: England get off to an ok start with a 1 - 1 draw against France:

Good performance by England! bossed it! Best game of the euros so far with the most biast ref so far! #England #Euro2012

England have now failed to win in all EIGHT of their opening Euro games. That's all of them, ever. Yay! #euro2012

Lol Ukraine qualf'd for their first ever EURO and its only because of auto qual for hosting the damn thing. #ComeOnMan #EURO2012

Not gonna defend our way to a euro win, but it could've been worse! #England #Euro2012

Until now, a single Chelsea player didn't get a win in the Euros #CFC #Euro2012

1-1 Just about the right result, still not won the opening game in any euro's, #notagoodomen #euro2012

8pt profit from #sortyoursport tips on the Euros so far #spreadtheword #england #Euro2012

Why are France and England playing a friendly in Ukrane when Euro's on? #euro2012

Could have been worse I guess  We could have lost. But then again the French weren't exactly ooh laa laa #euro

Decent start to the euros, important not to lose. Need to win the next two tho. Ref let himself down in my opinion. #ThreeLions #euro2012

Decent start to the euros. I'm happy with a point! #Euro2012

Loving the Irish coverage of the Euro's; an Irish bloke, Liam Brady and of course Dietmar Hamann #pundits #euro2012

live tweeting the EUROS is the best football commentary ever. #Euro2012

Brilliant  No country with the #Euro has beaten one without it,

90% of the updates i see are of #Euro2012. I would pay attention but i dont have a favorite euro team

Good game tonight! Good result  the last time we drew the first game at the Euro's we made the semi's! #England #euro2012 #

No country with the #Euro has beaten one without it

England 1 France 1.  England have still never won their first game in any Euro championship #Euro2012

Co-hosts Ukraine are the only country to be making their European Championship debut at Euro 2012. #Euro2012

Sweden scored at least once in all 10 of their Euro 2012 qualifiers. #Euro2012

It's a shame, I tuned into the first round of Euro 2012 to see some football being played. Hopefully some will break out in Rd 2 #Euro2012

#France were much the better team. If #England continue this negative  football they'll stay the only euro club to have never won #Euro2012

Still in shock that Gerrard said before the match that they were happy with a draw. Never be happy with a draw #Euros #Euro2012 #England

Still England yet to win an opening euro game #euro2012

I think Eurovision policy is contagioous and now affecting the Euro's! The ref clearly doesn't like the English! #Euro2012

Having a real job channel surfing to avoid the Euro's #Euro2012

Ok guys. I love soccer. Euro 2012 makes me happy. Especially if England advances. #EURO2012

Why is it that all good games are drawing 1-1 at Euro this year #Euro2012 #thissucks

Currently cheering for #Sweden purely because I put Rasmus Elm in my Euro Fantasy Football Team. #hopingforpoints #Euro2012

Of all the 368 players at Euro 2012, Andriy Shevchenko has enjoyed the LONGEST international career. He made his debut in 1995. #euro2012

Andriy Voronin (32)  Andriy Shevchenko (35), two Premiership flops, starting together at a Euro Championship finals. Unbelievable #Euro2012

I wondered what happened to big cliff lazarenko! Now playing in Euros #euro2012

I hope the Euro's isnt going to have this many 1-1 draws considering theres been three 1-1 draws already! #Euro2012

Euro 2012 is just an exhibition of middle age strikers showing that they're not as good as they used to be. #euro2012

I like this Euro 2012 fact: No country with the Euro has beaten one without it.#bbcsport #Euro2012

If #England can't beat these two teams then it might as well just not bother showing up for Euro 2016. #Sweden #Ukraine #Euro2012

Who would have thought that Ukraine/Sweden would be the most exciting game I've watched so far in EURO 2012? #shevchenko #EURO2012

The Euro 2012 camera men have a unique skill of finding babes in the stands #Euro2012

Russia and Italy best teams so far in the euros. #euro2012

Well still no opening Euro Championship game win but a decent result all the same. Well done England, looking forward to Friday!! #euro2012

The overall quality of play has been low this euro, if u ask me. The idea of not conceding directly effects the attacking play. #EURO2012

Strange how euro 2012 players hit the ground so easy?! Watch an ice hockey match and see the abuse mid season Really?! #euro2012

So far the euros have been shit! No excitement, very little goals, very little quality! #euro2012

Euro 2012 sponsors on red alert over claims of #racism  #Euro2012 #marketing #crisismanagement  #usmmediagroup

These euros really struggling to entertain. used to be cagey from knock out stages, now from game 1. #euro2012

Am I the only one who thinks that the stadiums are really nice in this Euro edition? #Euro2012

Was finally able to watch a euro game! France-England was pretty boring, and hopefully, Ukraine-Sweden picks up the pace! #euro2012

In bed watching the euros. Best way to spend a Monday evening. #Euro2012

The Euro's are missing one thing, Fellaini's Hair #Euro2012

Shevchenko!!! This is what the euros are about, the big players making a difference! Ukraine 1 - 1 Sweden #euro2012

Euro's started summer out right with 2 sick games a day. #EURO2012

Yes Shevchenko has scored more goals then messi now at the euros #Euro2012

the big countries in the euros are so boring. the smaller, more underated teams are more exciting to watch #EURO2012

#Euro2012 Shevchenko is the first person to score at Euros who has played/playing for Chelsea well done to the Ukrainian

I'm glad Bulgaria ain't at the Euros Never forgive them for saying Scarborough was boring back euro 96 #Euro2012

Ibrahimovic and Ribery would make great looking pirates #justsaying #euros #eurosbuzz #euro2012

APARECE UN GRANDE DEL FUTBOL UCRANiANO GOOOL DE #SHEVCHENKO #UKRAiNE 1 #SWEDEN 1 #EURO #EUROESPN #EURO12 #EURO2012

What happens if every game in a Euro champs group ends up one all? #euro2012

The last game of Matchday 1's contests at this Euro final certainly is making a case against Spain/Italy as best game so far #Euro2012

In most of these Euro matches so far  the equalizing goal is scored almost right after the first. #Euro2012

Nothing better in the Euros/World Cup than a home nation scoring #euro2012

Love the atmospher Euro tournament..supporters must just stop their fighting#Euro2012

Euro games are always fun to watch #Euro2012

Wow! Just seen the score at euros 1-1 #Euro2012

The euro has had so many headers, beautiful goals. #Euro2012

I think as we are approaching the end of the first phase of the euros we can all safely say that there is no hope for Ire

shevchenko setting records. Oldest striker at euros. Now oldest player to score two goals. #Euro2012

He is NOW THE OLDEST player to score TWICE in the Euro's #Euro2012 #Soccer

Waaheeeyyy Southampton get a mention at the Euros :P #saintsfc #Euro2012

Ukraine vs Sweden. What a match I feel the passion of the euros finally! Givin me the chills this is why I love footbal

Shevchenko racking up the points for my euro fantasy team #euro2012

Best moment of the euro's so far is Shevchenko scoring that 1st goal #euro2012

Wow, what a performance by Ukraine's Shevchenko! Oldest player ever to score 2 goals at the Euros. #UKRvSWE #EURO2012

Right so far My predictions for the the Euros have been all wrong,every single one,at least I am consistent! #Euro2012 #UKRvSWE

That makes him the oldest player to score a grace at the Euros. #UKRvSWE #EURO2012 #Schevchenko

Imagine the Euros came to Scotland. How amazing would that be! #Euro2012

Theres been a mexican wave in everygame of the euros so far! #EURO2012

Didn't know the home team was in charge of hiring the refs in the Euro's. #pathetic #Euro2012

If Finland would make to the Euro's it would certainly face Greece,that would be the worst blue and white scrimmage ever.#emfutis #euro2012

ITALY!!! #soccer #Euro2012 all pumped up for the euro!!!

Its d #ACMILAN show right now but talking bout incentive, if u dunno, Ukraine where offered 12 million euros 2 win d tournament. #Euro2012

#England #Euro2012 #Euros  if Scholes had gone to world cup not a chance he would have lasted full game #oldgingerberk

Absolutely delighted for Shevchenko, what a moment for him and for Ukraine. Legend. #EURO #EURO2012

None a these sides deserve to lose  #Euro2012. Quite a change from the boring Euros.

This Euro Cup, I'm cheering for whichever team has the highest cheekbones. #euro2012

So funny to listen to the BBC announcers during Euro 2012 compared to the ones on ESPN. Much funnier and even a tad sarcastic. #Euro2012

The best part of the euro is when the camera men scan the fans and zoom into the sexiest female fans! #Euro2012
