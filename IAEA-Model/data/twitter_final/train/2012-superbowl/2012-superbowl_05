That's rough to tear your ACL in the #SuperBowl but not as rough as your tactless team releasing you the day before.

The way those large men are touching that ball is making me uncomfortable. #SuperBowl #sb46

Even though my didn't make it, I'm happy for the Gmen!!!! #superbowl

Still, compared the old days, this was lame. Back in there were at least 5-10 really unique spots.  #superbowl

My favorite #SuperBowl ad: Hands down The Voice with Betty White.

Eli Manning 2 Super Bowl MVPs, his 2nd in Indianapolis, where he shined from the shadow of his older brother Peyton Manning. #superbowl

Yes an entrepreneur with an idea can change the world. & she's just as likely to be female. #superbowl

Glad I watched the #SuperBowl, after all. Wow, what a game.

I love a parade! Congrats Giants for making #NY proud! #SuperBowl

Eli is the Obama of QBs. He'll make you crazy because he never gets angry, never gets excited. But, in the end, he wins. #superbowl

If the Giants win that proves the key to winning the #SuperBowl is to have half your team on IR and get the Wild Card spot

Best Super Bowl ads: Kia, Doritos, Pepsi Max, NFL Evolution, Chevy Sonic, Volkswagen. #superbowl

im already more entertained by #TheVoice then i was during the #SuperBowl
