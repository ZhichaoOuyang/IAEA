#Brexit would be the very best idea since the inception of the EU. Explained here

Ooh , why is Obama saying 'queue', must be difficult for a 'part-Kenyan' to say a word in English #ObamaInUK #brexit

why don't you open up your borders without restrictions to Mexico if you want Britain to do the same? #Brexit #keepoutofit

Another lie,  to refer to as part-Kenyan smacks of #racism #Brexit

Nothing said today has changed my mind. I'm voting 'OUT'. The UK has to look after its own interests #Brexit

Feel like you need to cut through all the #Brexit spin?You're welcome!

#Brexit  Staggering how MSM hide even the most essential facts re EU. Here they are

take a look at the comments in here. Not one supporting the original tweet. #Brexit

If Barack says post-#Brexit UK would be 'at the back of the queue' for a US trade deal he should assume we'd be so for any US wars as well

#EU Remain side lead at 11% but the vote likely to be much closer. #Brexit is still a real chance.

There are a lot more #British #business executives pipping for a #Brexit than you think -

#ObamaInUK wasn't sure but, now voting out. Back of the queue. Your buddy did more harm than good for you. #Brexit

The #Brexit is pissing off the globalists. Good! #UK should keep going  the #USA needs to elect

Barack Obama says #Brexit would leave UK 'back of the queue' -  Threats from President over our right to vote. SODOFF

Obama triggers the nation's 'Out' voters.  #Brexit gains ground with help of Obama. The quiet no voters triggered to speak out. #ObamaInUK

US soldiers died for freedom in Europe. But now betrays them siding with the antidemocratic imperialist EU. Shame on the USA #Brexit

Its true we don't know what happens if we #Brexit, but we don't know what happens if we stay. At least if we leave, we have some control.

I can't see Obama's tactless comments being taken kindly by either side. Hopefully done #BREXIT #LeaveEU a massive favour.

Obama keep your nose out. Uk don't lead Europe we all know it's Germany that do. Sort your own shit out #brexit

That s #Brexit could be s real bugger :-)

If you're a #Brexit fan, might be better to give excellent W'room a miss today.

I wonder why #IDS chose the for his #Brexit immigration scaremongering article? Why not the or ? #ohisee

#Brexit Someone inform President Obama that American jobs urgently needs the USA to strike a deal w/ the world's 5th biggest economy #KeepUp

Magnificent from -- underscoring the ineptitude of #Leave  #Brexit,  Boris' Trump transformation

How quickly the #Brexit camp has gone from ardent 'America trade will replace the EU' advocates to 'we don't need America'. Hilarious

The sour grapes of #Brexit wrath: Barack Obama EU referendum intervention

You still wouldn't have joined if it wasn't for PH.You only ever look after yourselves,like you're trying to do with #Brexit

#Brexit. We know the US know how to get what they want, so is #backofthequeue another way of saying trade embargo? What is Obama afraid of.

Seems to have lost the plot since the referendum was called and Boris came out for #Brexit  I am amazed

Remember that is done. He has no respect or credibility  after #Brexit will be gone

He should go to the back of the queue #VoteLeave #Brexit

60 days left until the EU Referendum! RT if you think every vote is crucial #EUref #Brexit #Remain

Obama wd like to stitch UK into trade deal negotiated by fragmented EUrocrats. Useful template for UK to avoid pitfalls when we #brexit.

The pro #Brexit camp would have been better off just posting everyone a copy of 'Let England Shake' by PJ Harvey.

Still can't get the image out of my head of a foreign leader threatening the UK while Cameron obediently stands beside him.#Brexit#POTUS

Brexiters should have the honesty to admit that if Obama had backed their position they would be worshipping the ground he walks on #EUref

Agree about Boris, but his point is valid. Obama IS a hypocrite. US meddling again. Despite Boris and Farage, #Brexit is right

You begin to wonder whether Boris Johnson might be a sacraficial plant? #VoteLeave #Brexit

needs to stop meddling in British political affairs. Allowed an opinion but shouldnt be campaigning for either side. #KeepOut #Brexit

Obama praises Merkel for her migration policies. Enough said? #strongerIN #remain #brexit

Come November he'll be Mr Nobody from Nowheresville, Illinois.#Brexit

Who has done well out of the last time we took US advice,BLAIR Im sure CAMERON will follow suit  b well rewarded #Brexit

can't wait to see the back of #Obama he has to be the worst #americanpresident of recent modern history #Brexit

You'd swear #Brexit was a strictly economic issue and not a political one.

Happy St Georges Day Prez.  Weve fought our own corner and can do so again #Brexit

if Obuma doesn't want to deal with us, so what?I'm sure China, Australia, Canada etc., etc., wouldn't bat an eye lid?#Brexit

Yeah, we'd be trading. But on what terms? Once again #Brexit campaigners completely fail to understand the issues.

#Obama in a #Brexit storm after telling #British voters to stay in the EU or else | #AmericaStandsWithBritain

EU 20+ yrs never had audit passed off. Nothing but corrupt, self serving assholes. Obscene pensions for eurocronies #Brexit

Why is Obama getting involved? Money and power of course, can't have an independent democratic UK upsetting the corporate applecart #Brexit.

look forward to direct trade deals with our Commonwealth, something e/useless currently forbids?#Brexit

We have created an explainer video talking about the Top 10 #Brexit questions before the #EUreferendum

Does #POTUS  actually believe that all those who died fighting the Nazis did it to give us another European superstate? #Brexit

Stupid enough to vote #Brexit = stupid enough to see words as a threat. Cos you realise he's right. And it scares you. #EUref

Very balanced and informative talk about Brexit on LBC radio at the mo!#Brexit

#Brexit = Scottish independence = Little England. but post-colonial-half-Kenyan-GB-haters want UK to stay in. I'm confused

Boris Johnson: 'US lectures' on #Brexit 'paradoxical' Putting it p[politely!!

You can be pro #Brexit You can be pro human rightsBut you can't be both.

It took Barack Obama to crush the #Brexit fantasy | Jonathan Freedland  brilliant article

Why the fuss about #Obama's comments? Decision not influenced by him. make your own mind up. #Brexit

you must lead a very dull life if that's the highlight!#ObamaInUK #Brexit

Also by supporting #Brexit, the Left is proving it's unable to find common ground when Corbyn is in need of it. Who wins? The Tories

I respect Obama's attitude towards embracing change moving forward but our STRONGEST way forward is OUT OF THE EU#VoteLeave #Brexit

#Shakespeare400 All the world's a stage - each must play a part but not Obama after howler on UK at the back of the queue on #Brexit indeed!

Let's leave the EU for a less corrupt, more secure, more democratic and BRIGHTER future. #brexit

We don't need any reason other than knowing who we are and where we come from, for us to say, time for a change! It's our own choice #Brexit

The more we outperform the EU, the more we'll be flooded with migrants. Too many where I live, and getting worse. #brexit

The EU project is collapsing and that's why the banks, IMF and Obama want the UK to stay. They hope we'll help to prop it up. #bbcaq #Brexit

THIS WILL BE THE SCENE IN THE UK IF CAMERON HAS HIS BULLYING WAY FFS. #Brexit#VoteLeave #UKIP

Nope.  We are the backbone of the EU, not vice-versa.  It's time for the corrupt to deal with it themselves.  #brexit

Only after #Brexit will we finally realise just how dependant the Eu is on Great Britain. Let's lead the way.

and that'll continue after #Brexit instead of the EU dragging us down.

#bbcaq What is it the UK produces that countries will be queuing for? #Brexit Apart from tax havens for corporations  olgarch portfolios?

Obama's lecture to Brits is absurdly hypocritical. #Brexit

Obama said it but the Cameron wrote it the tosser #Brexit

But you said TTIP could only be stopped from inside the EU? #Inconsistent #Brexit #VoteLeave #TakeControl

The #British need to be better informed of #TTIP and the devastation it will cause. Without #Brexit TTIP will happen

I just feel like #brexit is more a liberation for England's would be domestic tyrants than from eu tyranny
