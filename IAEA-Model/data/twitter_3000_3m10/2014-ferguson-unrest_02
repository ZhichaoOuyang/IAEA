Welcome to #Ferguson, where you need an ID to vote, but not to shoot tear gas and rubber bullets at the citizens

Citizens must demand EVERY police stop be recorded officially once any officer requests your ID. Stop abuse of power/corruption! #Ferguson

Awaiting Missouri Gov #JayNixon  Highway Patrol to speak on situation in #Ferguson following #Friday unrest:

Police are the reason for civli unrest. It's not that hard to understand. Curfew achieves nothing. #Ferguson

Tomorrow, we'll have the latest breaking details on the unrest in #Ferguson, Missouri.

another media outlet using headlines to give impression #Ferguson community are to blame for unrest and deserve a curfew.

This isn't a state of emergency, it's a state of unrest and injustice. #Ferguson

Chief Thomas Jackson is to blame for this recent mayhem and unrest #Ferguson

When we had civil unrest here in 2001 b/c of an unarmed man being killed by police, the curfew was 9 pm-6 am.  #Ferguson

People want answers! And until they get them, there will be anger and unrest. Just answer the damned questions. #Ferguson #MikeBrown

#MyDailyTweet The #Ferguson Police Department is responsible for the unrest in North County. THEY created this.

Will/Should the people of #Ferguson comply with this curfew or will it result in more civil unrest?

Is #Ferguson a forewarning of greater levels of civil unrest in the future due to social, cultural and economic inequality?

Though, if cops are removing badges and id no.s, I don't expect #Ferguson after #curfew to be very safe.

Man this #Ferguson stuff has got out of control criminals giving the peaceful protesters a bad image  starting more violence  unrest

Change will come to #Ferguson once all buildings are destroyed or at least gutted.  Will that help unemployment? Help the civil unrest?
