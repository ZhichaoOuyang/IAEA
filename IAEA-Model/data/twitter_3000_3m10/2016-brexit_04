#IDS #Budget #EUreferendum So IDS resigns from DWP over budget ( he says)-next one the Justice Secretary over the Queen and Brexit maybe?

IDS we want you back. You are one of the few cabinet ministers who thinks sense. #Brexit #UKIPNOW

love to see that analysis just to avoid the project fear taunts from the #brexit straw clutchers

So Ian Duncan Smith has resigned in principle over disability cuts? Or political manoeuvring over Eu #brexit and the PM job? Hmm.

Their whole attitude of late has been most lamentable. So much so, Its creepy! #BREXIT

Iain Duncan Smith's resignation as Work and Pensions Sec leaves him free to speak his mind over #Brexit from back benches.. and he will

Ian Duncan Smith resigns over disabilitycuts. Does he have a heart? Or is this to free himself to campaign for #Brexit ? #IDS I'm cynical.

IDS can now put his full political weight behind the #Brexit campaign.  #No2EU

Throw Europe into the Tory mix. Stand well back and smugly watch the fireworks. Works every time. #EUref #IDS

More likely pushed out by no 10 due to #Brexit support

Divisions will be hard to stitch together post 23rd #brexit

Can't help wander how much the EU referendum played into this as well #IDS #Brexit

He does not, it is just opportunism from an anti EU minister, nothing to do with principles, all to do with #Brexit

Plus, IDS resigning frees him  from Cabinet collective responsibility   Cameron-imposed 'consensus'.Expect him to campaign for #Brexit.

If you think things are bad now wait until Cameron is forced to resign on #Brexit Heaven help us #ToriesOut

So #IanDuncanSmith resigns over cuts to #ESA - pull the other one this is all bout #Brexit

IDS resigns saying cuts are perceived as political rather than necessary. Strong stuff. But also leaves him free to campaign on #Brexit

Having difficulty believing this has been done through any sort of altruism. #brexit anyone? #NastyParty

I suspect the #IDS resignation has more to do with #Brexit than with disability benefit plans.

Yes, all about #Brexit.  He has never hidden his hatred of disabled people.

As if he had absolutely nothing to do with the #PIPcuts plans!  Something stinks. #IDS Sights on #Brexit job?

Row over disability benefits provides a convenient resignation excuse for Iain Duncan Smith increasingly at odds with PM over #Brexit

Anything to do with challengin Camermoron on #Brexit ? I agree - not straightforward given his appalling track record of cuts

So after years of hammering the poor and disabled IDS decides that now is the time to resign on principle of harsh cuts? More like #Brexit

you're right and my guess is that his #Brexit support meant this issue was effectively used to push him out the door

Won't be Priti Patel. She's also preparing to dump David Cameron alongside his #Brexit referendum. #IDSStalkingHorse

IDS couldn't be bothered defending cuts; thought he'd blow things up and destroy Cam/Osborne credibility for the #EUref

Iain Duncan Smith's resignation over concerns about #disabilitybenefitcuts means he is freer to campaign for #Brexit. #EU #EUreferendum

Isolated from the right by his stance on #EUref, now facing backlash from Tory moderates emboldened by #IDS. Almost feel sorry for Cameron.

IDS is the first casualty of the #EUreferendum Tory split. Hopefully Osborne will follow him through the exit door.

#IDSresigns didn't see that coming,but I respect his reasons! Who else deserts #DavidCameron before June? What has George got to say #Brexit

PIP cuts have nothing to do with the EU. Stop conflating the issue. A Tory excuse to defend brutal cuts and back #Brexit

but you don't believe it, surely given how much of an attack dog on the poor he his? #Brexit

People say like UK would suffer from #Brexit forever. I guess only in the short run. Long run opens much more opportunities and freedom.

Under pressure from treasury to make all those cuts. Supporting #Brexit Opinion will change.

But is there a single person who respects IDS (if any) that wasn't in favour of #brexit already?

Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man apparently resigning on principle rather than be sacked after losing #Brexit ref. #IDS

John McCain: #Brexit would threaten US security #EUref #UKinEU #StrongerIn

Anyone else suspicious that Ian Duncan Smith's resignation was secretly over #Brexit disagreement with Cameron?

Gotta be positioning himself for another cabinet role if there is a #Brexit. He's had his chips with #DWP

All about Brexit this person has no interest in the poor or vulnerable

not sure, export/import of residual waste might be banned, as it is now already the case with non-EU states. #brexit

All bets are off now over a civilised EURef. Going to get very bloody. At least they can afford more tampons to plug the wounds #Brexit

And all over twitter #Brexit Tory MP's defending IDS and the same bunch telephoning BBC, see a pattern yet

Any ideas what #borisjohnson  has promised arch-villain #ids in his government?#brexit

Yes this doesn't make sense. I suspect it has more to do with #Brexit

IDS resigns! Wonder if is because he lost legal challenge to keep Universal Credit problems secret?#Brexit #EUref

IDS resigning is all about #brexit. His thinking, destroy Gideon, in turn destroying Cameron, Boris installed as PM. Betcha.

#IainDuncanSmith resignation is first stab at #GeorgeOsborne to get him out of the way in the runup to #Brexit. The IDS of March.

Did #IDS,one of the most right wing members of the party, resign over a  too conservative budget or is it part of his #brexit strategy?

#IDS now free to campaign for #Brexit without cabinet restrictions. Hopefully he'll make the same mess of it as he did at DWP.

You can add disingenuous to the list of qualities of the #brexit bunch of ministers - firstly Boris and now #ids's faux resignation

The resignation of #IDS could be the key turning point in an over-the-top dramatisation of the #EUref in ten years time

#QuietMan has his say. #Osborne has gone too far. Will do #Brexit a power of good.

Revolution around the corner if we don't #Brexit.

Hopefully this means Osborne's days are numbered. This and a #Brexit means Osborne's hold over Westminster will likely end.

IDS has resigned because he disagrees with disability benefit cuts.bollocks, this is about the #EUreferendum

#IDS resignation - about cuts or #Brexit? slimy fuck

obviously something to do with #Brexit. Even in his resignation letter he's crowing about the cuts he's made

Well, it does give him some advance moral high ground to run for Tory leadership if #Brexit wins.

You know as well as I do just as much as the JCMD/Boris #brexit tiff.

Big business and #US to have major say in #EU trade deals  This has to be stopped even if it means #Brexit

Hopefully #IDS will now be free to campaign fully for #Brexit.  A man of principles.

#newsnight It's unsaid that #IDS is after a job after #brexit boost and can do what he likes with the disabled once the EU laws go.

Nah, it's all about the #Brexit and kicking anti-brexit Osborne I reckon

Oh Brian, you don't really think it's about the cuts do you? It's about kicking anti-#Brexit Osborne.
