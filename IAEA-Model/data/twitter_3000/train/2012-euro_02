Poland 1-0 up. Cue predictable flood of jokes about Greek exit from the Euros. Who's going to bail them out? #euro2012

Are Greece more concerned with loosing at the Euros or loosing the Euro? #euro2012 #euros

A guys manhood is on the line if you choose big brother over the euros #euro2012

Euro 2012 and French open semis and we Have to work? But isn't that part of being in the sports biz #euro2012 #hungryforsports

Something tells me the Greek players may also be distracted by what else is happening in their country #Euro2012 #euro #economy

If Greece win Euro 2012 as part of the country's debt problems, they sell the trophy to John Terry, who will claim it as his own. #Euro2012

Watching the Polish-Greek game in EURO.Not much happening at the moment but it is always nice to see half naked guys run around! #Euro2012

After watching 1st 20 minute I'm not too downhearted about getting Poland in euro sweepstake #euro2012

I've missed the opening ceremony and the first goal of Euro 2012 cos I am stuck on the m25. #Excellent #Euro2012

No wonder Greece is bankrupt, clearly spent all their money on making to the Euro's! #Euro2012

Euros have made me very lazy! Just gna sit and watch all the football in store! #Euro2012

Poland rocking the euro's by scoring the first goal in the first match..#euro2012

Poland has come out firing for the euros and Greece looks like they forgot to wake up this morning #euro2012

Papadopolos off and Papadopolos on for Greece. Little known Euro fact #1 - Both are related to the laundry owner in Eastenders. #Euro2012

If I was a euros commentator I would not want to commentate this game. #euro2012

you had a flutter on the Euros mate? I've done Holland to win  RVP or Benzema for top scorer. #euro2012 #betting

Have Greece given up teamwork as an austerity measure? Very disjointed so far #euros #euro2012

Papadopolos off and Papadopolos on for Greece. Little known Euro fact #1 - Both are related to the laundry owner in Ea

I'm enjoying the Euros already. Superb. #euro2012

This is all part of the Greek economy drive. Their government have lumped on Greece to lose. Poland could actually save the Euro #Euro2012

Why can't US sports fill stadiums and have fans like euro soccer? #alwayspacked #EURO2012

Juu messi ako euro? Smh

I bet Greece wished they pulled out of the Euro now #Euro2012

Has Greece really won Euro? By looking at their game it doesn't seem they deserve to play Euro #Euro2012

They keep saying Greece should get out of the Euro, looks like they wont have to wait much longer #Euro2012

How I wished I could watch Euro match at home now. #Euro2012

Not the first time Greece have needed a sub in the Euro #Euro2012

welcome to euro 2012 euro.show your spirit friends!!!#euro2012

Its not a question of is there going to be racism at the euros it a question of how much :( #Euro2012

I want to know where the 'Greece Pub' is, because I don't know how they got their pub team into the Euros #euro2012 #shambolic

I must have been living in cuckoo land. I so wasn't aware that Euro 2012 had started.great more fucking football! #euro2012 #boring

First red of the Euros in the first game, brilliant!#euro2012

Being sent off in the the first game of the euros, gutted!! #Euro2012

As per usual the first 45 minutes of the #Euros has been more or less uninspiring. Cracking finish on the first goal of #Euro2012 tho!

Red card in the first game of the euro's! #Euro2012

#Greece just got a #RedCard at the #EURO2012, ummm is that like getting a red card from #Euro? We shall see

Germany will win the euro's, heard it here first.  #Euro2012

First horrible decision of the euros'. That wasn't a foul. Pathetic. #euro2012

Dunno what Greece are playing at. No side has ever won Euros by being defensive and scoring few goals #euro2012 #euro2004

This ref just ruined the opening match of the euro #EURO2012

Poor refereeing. Neither of that. Chaps yellows were fouls. Bad start to the euros. #Euro2012

The 1st embarrassment of the Euros. How is that a sending off. #Euro2012

1st goal of EURO 2012 #euro2012 Poland goes crazy. Kuba to Lewandowski to make it 1-0 Poland over Greece. Dortmund duo come up big already

PREMIER SCANDALE DE L'EURO, PREMIER SCANDALE DE L'EURO #Euro2012 #BUZZ #BREAKINGNEWS #BIGBOOS #Raccolagebasdegamme

horrible yellow card.horrible red card.horrible way for euro 2012 to begin #euro2012

defo thino euros will be interesting i think a red card already #Euro2012

The Spanish ref blaming the Greeks for the failing Euro and Spanish economy? #onlyexplanation #Euro2012

#Euro2012 and that's it #Poland vs #Greece Poland up by 1 and not the first #redcard of the #euro That sucks for Greece#rt #FollowBack

I feel sorry for the Greeks on that one. Both decisions borderline yellows at harshest. Who sent the NBA refs to the Euros? #Euro2012

Hope that decision isn't a sign of what's to come in the euros #Euro2012

Greece on route out of the euros for the second time this month #Euro2012

Looks like your going to get a yellow for sneezing in this Euros #euro2012

Greece's Euro hopes going the same way as their economy #Euro2012

Euro 2012 starting today. Watching the Poland Greece game. Can't believe that red card and yellow card given to Greece. #Euro2012

This ref is a cheat, not even descrete about it. Feel for greece. What a bad way to start the euros. #euro2012

solid refereeing performance to start of the euros #euro2012

These euros are going to be shit if all the decent players get booked #Euro2012

This is the first Euro tournament where Twitter is a big thing Lots has changed since '08. Makes big events like this better. #EURO2012

Euros is already goin off! Cynical refs decisions and angry fans. I love football #euro2012

45 minutes in the Euros and already 'interesting' decisions by the referee. #talkingpoint #EURO2012

Of all the people to be dishing out handouts to the Greeks in the Euros, it's the Spanish #Euro2012

Shit start to the euro's for the Ref after a shit season #EURO2012

Weakest two yellow cards I've seen! Euro referees see things very differently to English refs #euro2012 #PolandvGreece

Greece just aren't very good at staying in the Euro anymore. #BadJoke #Euro2012

The ref has obviously lost a wedge of cash in the Euro zone crisis and is, like everybody else, blaming the Greeks. #euro2012

Will avoid the obvious puns about the Greek football team sinking faster than the Euro. #Euro2012

Drama already in the euros ! Great first half. Referee is horrid similar to . #euro2012 #euros

Great 1st half to start the Euros. Had everything: penalty shout, red card, a goal and plenty of decent chances. #MayItContinue #Euro2012

looks like the common currency isnt the only euro's the greeks will be soon out of.#political satire #Euro2012

Yeah so these euro refs are fucking losers #greece #Euro2012 #handball! #pissed

45mins into the euros and we not short of drama #euro2012

#France is taking the Euro Cup this time around! #EURO2012

Enjoy the first goal of the Euro tournament. #Euro2012 #EuroESPN

Hope all the euros ain't going to be Redford like this #Euro2012

#Euro2012 Apparently not only the Premiership reeks of Poor Officiating smh Some Woeful Officiating Already in the Euros.

The Euro's are here! Hoping the Dutch win it all. #euro2012

Three survivors from Greece Euro 2004 winning squad. Karagounis, Katsouranis  Chalkias. Half-time experience needed #Euro2012

Haft time #Poland deserving the 1-0 lead but the ref fucked everything up with a bad red card #bollox #euros #euro2012

pls close this euro i not wand see a shit referee #euro2012

Greece down to 10 men, demand the rest of the Euro lend them another #Euro2012

Wow, already off to an awful start for the euros. Lets hope this idiot doesn't ref any knockout games with these terrible calls. #euro2012

The ref clearly blames the Greeks for the Euro crisis #Euro2012

I hope the refereeing in the first game of Euro 2012 is not representative of the referring for the entire tournament to

thought the Euro's are meant to be of the best teams and referees in europedon't think so! #Euro2012

If all the refs are like this this euros is gonna be shocking! #wankrefeering #shitdecisions #Euro2012

I apologize to followers in advance about how much stuff i will tweet to do with the Euro's. #EURO2012

Can you appeal against red cards at the EURO's? #Euro2012

Terrible refereeing! Ruined the game already, if this is the standard of refereeing in the euros, England are fucked! #Euro2012

that ref has given 16 yellows in 19 La Liga matches! No clue why he was chosen for the Euros. #Euro2012

It's such a pitta to see a red card in the first game of the Euros #Euro2012

#FridayNight - #Euro2012 and a chance of winning the Euro Millions ; )  First I need to drag my sorry ass out of work

Greece are already out of the Euros in the first 45 minutes of the tournament . #Euro2012

who thought it would be a good idea to let this guy ref the euros? #euro2012

Historic Euro gets under way | #Sakapfet ::  #euro2012

So, my Euro dream team, I had Lewandowski captain who scored and Pisczek who got the assist. #Euro2012

euros are already brilliant and gonna get better #euro2012

The awkward moment when you're from Denmark and you look at the Pools/Groups of EURO 2012 and you know you're fucked.#Euro2012

No amount of Greek footballing misery will ever atone for Euro 2004 but this will do for now #euro2012

#euro2012 Greeks must be heartily sick of the word euro. I predict an early exit.

Euro 2012 had 59 injuries before it started. More than any other European Championship in history. (via #euro2012

Idk how Greece won these euro's in 2004 #Euro2012

Euro is like playing FIFA red card for nothing #EURO2012

So it truly will be the fans and referees who control Euro 2012. #shame #euro2012

fact: the euro is harder to win than the world cup. #euro2012

I predict 'Greeks to leave Euros zone' headline. I'd put good money on it. #Euro2012 #goinghome

POL 1-0 GRE (HT) #Euro2012 - Only one country won a Euro opener after trailing at half time [FRA 4-5 YUG, in 1960 (2-1 at HT)]

We 've got it..You dont want Greece at the Euro..#Euro2012

Good to see BBC have got Clarence Seedorf back for the Euros #speakssense #Euro2012

Worst opening match ever in euro's history #EURO2012

I hope the gods of economic recovery grant Greece or Spain a Euro 2012 win. #Euro2012

Remember the Greek players who overcame all the odds to win euro 2004? No? Stick BBC1 on, theyre all still playing #euro2012

Papastathopoulos didn't deserve either booking. Feel sorry for him, probably gonna play in these euros again now #euro2012

Question: Are we using #EURO2012 hashtag or #EUROS hashtag?

Euro's so far: diabolical red card, clear penalty not given and a couple of relatively average looking teams, great. #bbcfootball #euro2012

Well if this ref is an example of what is to come the euros will be ruined! #Euro2012

EURO CUP 2012 WOOOO ONE MONTH LONG LET'S GO!!! (Spain,Portugal,England) #Euro2012

If this is a taster of the refereeing at the Euros, there aren't gonna be many games ending with 22 players on the pitch. #Euro2012

Spanish referee punishing the Greeks for the looming Euro crisis. Inspired. #Euro2012

The ref is definitely blaming the Greeks for the Euro crisis #Euro2012

The referee announced he cant find his coin , the #Greek captain might have stolen it. #fuckin_economic_crisis :D #euro_2012 #euro2012

In honor of the Euro Cup 2012 here's a video from user using the Sonim #XP5300 as a football!  #Euro2012

BAH! Greece is a man down and down 0-1 against Poland before the end of the first half in the Euro cup. #EURO2012

would like to retract the previous tweet. believes Tunisia will win Euro 2012 #euro2012

This ref is shocking at the euros, Poland knocking the ball about well  Greece are really suffering on and off the pitch! #Euro2012

Insert Greek Euro related quip here #Euro2012

Euro 2012 begins today!! Here's the take from Spectacular Sports! #Euro2012 #Poland #Greece

#Papastathopoulos is the longest name to be sent off in the Euros. #Euro2012

There were 3 red cards handed out in Euro 2008. All 3 teams with the sent off player went on to lose the match. #Euro2012

he wants Greece out of Euro!!! #Euro2012

Euros got off to an entertaining start! Referee a clear Poland fan. #euro2012

Pretty good first half.. Lets hope the euro's continue like Better than the world cup was #euro2012

None of the yellows on Papastathopoulos was a yellow!!! Bad calls #Euro Cup #Euro2012

France + Spain in the Euro sweepstake, pretty confident #Euro2012

With this shit football, Greece will leave the Euro Championship well before the Eurozone. #Euro2012 #Grexit

Poland in the lead and being a better team. During euro in Poland. Dreams do come true :)) #euro2012 #Poland

Turns out all this talk about them leaving the Euro was actually in reference to an early #EURO2012 exit.

This ref is nearly as awful as Greece, maybe he's been payed in euros #Euro2012

Poland easily best team in euros so far #Euro2012

This ref is treating the Greeks like it's their fault there's a Euro crisis #Euro2012

Just when i thought my day could not get any worse, the euros have started! #euro2012 #nothappy

1-0 to Poland at half-time, with Greece down to 10 men. It's been an explosive start to Euro 2012. #gre  #pol #euro2012

If Greece needed an excuse to drag Spain and the rest of Euro into the shit, they've got one now.#TerribleRefereeing#Euro2012

Idiot of a ref, just ruined a perfectly good game of football, won't enjoy the Euro's at this stage. #Euro2012

How does a ref with 16 send offs in 19 La LIga games get a Euro match?  #Euro2012

Watching the Euro Cup. Already some controversy and a goal #tsn #euro2012

Maybe Greece should pull out of the euros? #Euro2012

Lewandowski has got the ball rolling for my fantasy euro team #Euro2012

#Euros #Euro2012 worst ref. Never a red never 2 booking. Need to man up

The EU has started kicking the Greeks out of the Euro one by one, starting with #Papastathopoulos . #Euro2012

Finally the euros are here!! Come on England (liverpool) !!! Hearts going with England, heads going for France!! #Euro2012

If Germany can ace this group which consist of former champions like Holland and Portugal.85 % chance they can win the Euros #Euro2012

Greece need another Euro bailout #EURO2012

Dutch team hears racist chants at Euro practice   #Euro2012

I hope all the Greece/Euro/Bailout puns haven't been used up by half time #Euro2012

Greece and Euros *really* aren't a good combo are they #Euro2012

Greece pretty much out of Euros. They're not playing well in the football either #Euro2012

missed the first half of the euros, whats all this about a bad red card decision? what happened? #Euro2012

Sick of the england patter in the euros already! #fuckoff! #euro2012

Excited for the Euro's to have 24 teams so it'll last longer. 32 games isn't enough. #Euro2012

not the first time greece have been fucked over in the euro #debt #euro2012

Jumps for a ball, gets a yellow card #BadLuckGreece #Euro2012 #Greece #Poland #PolandvsGreece #football #soccer #Euros #Euro

Uefa are determined not to let Greece win the Euros again as they will take the trophy straight to Cash for Gold #Euro2012

Play is underway for the second half, with Poland only 45' away from their historic first ever Euro win. #euro2012

So Greece has a player sent off and 2 injured. What a start to Euro 2012 #EURO2012

Looks like Greece will soon be leaving the Euro. And their football team is shite too #EURO2012

RT Gah, it's not *that* Euro we're meant to be leaving. #euro2012 #wtfref  #WTreF

#MUFC should have signed Lewendowski before the Euros. His price tag is only going to rise now #Euro2012

The Euros should just be a massive knockout. No need to piss around at the back then, you'd have to just win every game #euro2012

For how often euro football players flop, you would think they would be better at it. #DennisQuaidSchoolOfActing #Euro2012

I do not rate the Czechs in the slightest. I think they are the worse side at Euros. At that is saying something. Lump on Russia #euro2012

What a 1st game got the euro's! Can't see England's opener being this exciting #Euro2012

Wow what a start to the euros, 2 red cards, missed penalty, keeping blunders, questionable Reffing, #Euro2012

Dis is a rite game ta kick off da euros #Euro2012

Screw you Szczesny. Not a great start for my Euro 2012 fantasy team #euro2012

Great save. Keeper got inside Karagounis head.. Been a good start to the Euros, hopefully carries on for the rest of it! #Euro2012

This a great game to kick off the Euros its had everything. #Euro2012

don't know about anyone else but I'm enjoying the start to the euros #Euro2012

If this 1st euro game is any indication of the month ahead its gonna be a great tourny #euro2012

Commentator just said well it wasn't a bad penalty! True it was an absolutely miserable effort! #EUROS #Euro2012

What a mental game. Great start to the euros. #euro2012

Euro 12 and a quiet day at the museum  This is the life #euro2012

Gonna watch the euros on mute if this commentator remains this annoying. #euro2012

Damn this euro is starting off badass. Should be a great one to watch #Euro2012

Euro's already better than the world cup was - so dull. #Euro2012

1st game of the Euros and i can already tell that revision may have to take a back seat! #Euro2012

If the rest of the games are like this one the euros will be unforgettable #drama #passion #Euro2012

Salpingidis celebrating the red card for Poland there like they had won the Euros again! #Euro2012

My euro predictions have already been salpingidissed!! Grr but how could those Greeks miss that penalty!! #euro2012 #fb

The last time both teams had a man sent off in the Euros was Spain (Pizzi) vs Bulgaria (Hubchev) in the group stage of Euro 96. #Euro2012

I hope the euros continue in this way! #euro2012

#Euro2012 Another Greek tragedy involving Euro's - rubbish penalty but what was the Goal keeper thinking (was he even thinking??)

Euro awesomeness. Glad the Gooner got sent off! #Euro2012

Not a bad introduction to Euro 2012 for Przemyslaw Tyton - good save !!!! #Euro2012

You should well commentate at the euros! #propernuttybonkersavinitgeezer! Great game kick off #euro2012

Watching Euro Cup game 1 Poland vs Greece #EURO2012 #MAHMAN

Probably the greatest opening match the EUROs has ever seen. So much drama #EURO2012

Euro 2012 already more entertaining than the 2012 World Cup. Shame i've had a Kevin Keegan penalty prediction moment already. #Euro2012

the dressing room camera for the penalty after is an interesting touch! #euro2012 #euros

One game of Euros and already more story lines than one week of World Cup. #euro2012

1st game of the euros everyone said boring game. This has had everything #euro2012

a great start to the euros loads of drama. Best opening game ever #Euro2012

not a bad game to start the euro's tbh! #Euro2012

Tyton is the first legend of the Euros, straight of the bench for a penalty save. #euro2012

I tell you what, 4 weeks of this would be fantastic! Bring on more of the euros!! #Euro2012

This has been an awesome opening match. First pen  first sending off of the Euros. #UnpredictableFooty #Euro2012

Goal chopped off, offside, so little in it as well. What a match. This has to be one of the best opening matches in Euro history #Euro2012

Sad to see the opening of the Euro's marred by racism. Lets hope this is not going to set the tone of things to come. #Euro2012

#Euro2012: i want to believe that portugal will do a good euro, but i just don't think they're gonna do it.

I love how much everyone celebrates in the euros #passion #euro2012

Great opening game to the Euros. 1 bullet-header of a goal, 2 sendings off, a penalty save  a disallowed goal!! #controversy #Euro2012

Two red cards, one missed penalty what else could you ask from 1st game of Euro #Euro2012

First game of the Euro, as dramatic as the Euro Cup can get. #Euro2012

Never knew that Poland vs Greece could produce as much drama! Good start to the Euros! #Euro2012

Polish goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton is the first goalkeeper ever to save a penalty at the Euro Champs playing as a substitute. #Euro2012

WOW! What drama so far. Great game to watch #Euros #euro2012 #POLvsGRE

First game of Euro Cup simply insane. Wow. If this is an indication. #Euro2012

I'll admit, for the 1st game in the euros this is foooken crazy #Euro2012

never thought id see the day where i would watch a whole soccer match by myself #Euro2012

This is a great start to the euros. Unreal game! #euro2012

What the fuck is samaras doing at the euro's he's absolutly dog shit #Euro2012

Is there a worse player in the euros than Samaras? #absolutegarbage #nocomposure #euro2012

The Euros are on! Red cards, goals, penalties, zingoistic passion, Love it love it love it #euro2012

After looking for links i find out Euro 2012 is on solar sports.  #Euro2012

Looks like Samaras wasn't saving his best performances up all season for the Euros after all. #euro2012

my mum isn't 2 impressed about the fact the Euros have taken priority over the news.I won't tell her there is a 24hr news channel #Euro2012

We all got to pick our teams out of a hat at work for Euro 2012 - who did I get? SPAIN OF COURSE! #iloveSpain #euro2012 #Spain #Eeeek

Can't complain with this opener to the euros! The game has had a bit of everything, last minute winner on the cards? #Euro2012

Samaras is at the euros and i'm not. That hurts #euro2012  Although he is more eligible for Greece than me

Samaras Is Just Poor! Seen Better Players On A Sunday Morning! #fact #euro2012 #Euros

Euro 2012 has started come on down to 1410 to watch the games full sound and beer specials #Euro2012

If Samaras can play in the Euros so can I! #SeenBetterPubPlayers #Euro2012

#Football Fact: Polish keeper #Tyton is the first  goalkeeper ever to save a penalty at the Euro Champs playing as a

What were Greece thinking taking that spastic Samaras in the squad? Worst player at the Euros by a country fucking mile!!! #Euro2012

I fucking love the euros !! sorry but I absolutely do . #football

Absolute madness in the euro's, Karagounis was always going to miss that #Euro2012

i missed the kick off of the euro 2012 :( #Euro2012

Not a bad start to the Euro's. 2 red cards, 2 goals, missed penalty. #Euro2012

Euro refs already making bad calls on flops. #euro2012

Wired out. I'm done with the euro cup 2012. Very frustrating website. #Euro2012

I hate BBC commentators !  itv commentators ! might just watch the whole euros on mute #Euro2012

I like Samaras. He gives me the belief that even someone just as shit as me, has every chance of going to the Euro's. Thanks man! #Euro2012

Just saw an UBER cutie Polish fan. Can't wait to see all of the Euro countries' hotties. #Euro2012

Decent start to the euros. Plenty of talking points already. A late goal would top it off. #euro2012 #Poland #Greece

Here's a scary thought. The opening game of the next euros will probably have a player in it who wasn't even born during euro96 #euro2012

Remember when Milan Baros took the absolute piss at Euro 2004? hahaha #Euro2012

Euros is a great way relax after a minging day #euro2012

Poland v Greece..more entertaining than the whole of the world cup in 2010! Buzzing for the euros now! #euro2012 #footballisback

Poland have yet to win a match in Euro finals, come on Polanddddddddd #Euro2012

finished revision and been for a run, now watching the euros #Euro2012 #nightsorted

I think the MOTM in the 1st euro match is Salpingidis or Lewandowski, cause they're really playing well for the team today #EURO2012

The last time both teams had a man sent off in the Euros was Spain (Pizzi) vs Bulgaria (Hubchev) in the group stage of E

#Euro2012 - Karagounis is the 2nd player to miss a penalty in a Euro opener, following the footsteps of hungarian Sa

Samaras is to the Greek team what Greece is to the Euro #Euro2012

Not a big fan of regular soccer at all but I love tournament soccer (i.e. World Cup, Euro Championship) #Euro2012

whata game, 2 red cards a saved penalty 2 goals and ene to end fooball, great way to kick off the euro's #Euro2012

Currently watching what could be the worst Euro opening match EVER! Poland vs Greece #euro2012

Great first game in euro'snot expected #Euro2012

Poland and Greece setting the tone at Euro 2012.  2 red cards, a penalty kick and nail biting action.  #GreatStart #Euro2012

Id rather watch soccer than hockey. Futbol is a beautiful sport. #Euro2012

How can Greece fans afford to go to the euros? I thought they were all skint!#Euro2012 #GRE

Greece won the Euros and they were turd! England are turd now so is everybody writing us off before we've kicked a ball?! #Euro2012

Peavis just saved a great penalty for Poland in the euros !!! #Euro2012

Dammit my Twitter when weird at half time but good comeback by the #greeks #euro2012 #euros

Good advert for the euros the commentator saying two of the worst teams playin here lol #Euro2012

I have to say, it's certainly been an eventful start to #Euro2012 so far!#Euros #MIGHTYTYTON

this is probably one of the most entertaining/intense euro opener ever #EURO2012

Greece needs to be bailed out of euro crisis, footballers seems to know better on how to get out of a 10 men situation and score #euro2012

Greece given penalty. Misses Penalty #BadLuckGreece #Euro2012 #Euro #Euros #Uefa #Football #Greece #Poland #PolandvsGreece #Soccer #Funny

what a great way to start the euro 2 red cards and a tie game #Euro2012

Nice Match to open the competition of EURO 2o12. Tomorow HOLLAND Present. Orange Team alz Team Kompeni Belanda #Euro2012

Great first game of the euro's, looking forward to 30 other matches #euro2012

So far so good for the Euros, been pretty interesting but only due to the referee having an absolute shocker for the most part #Euro2012

Tyton form Poland was the 1st goalkeeper to save the penalty in Euro 2012! #Euro2012

Germany Champion of the euro. Mesut the best #Euro2012

Pres says Euro needs more stimulus. Euro must be his pet name for Michelle. He CAN'T mean print more EurosWiemar Republic much? #Euro2012

First football cliche from me for the euros. Footballit's a game of two halves #Euro2012

the purple euro banner thing with the  match statistic  is so beautiful :D #euro2012

Greece beat the hosts 2-1 in the opening game of Euro 2004 #Euro2012

Not a bad first game for the Euro's, nice little bit of controversy though with the refereeing #Euro2012

The Greeks arnt giving up. Great opening game to the Euros. #Euro2012 #EndToEnd

just done a euro's with Ireland on Fifa! Hopefully it works out the same in real life. #Ireland #Euro2012

Samaras is the real Greek Euro crisis. #Euro2012

Arshavin and Rosicky BOTH start in the next Euro game and BOTH start as captains! #Euro2012 #Arsenal

Greece playing like a 2004 when they win Euro! #Euro2012

You know euro started when you can hear your dad screaming at the tv.. #doyleproblems #euro2012

Games nearly over another match to watch straight after :D Gotta love the Euros #Euro2012

The greeks need to win the euro's they need the prize money to go towards the bailout fund #euro2012

#euro2012 I'm so proud of these greek boys! No wonder they won euro 2004. They do not give up.

Day 1 of the euro cup!!!! this will save my summer :)) #Euro2012

This is a game and half to start the euros (y) #Euro2012

Not a pretty start to the Euro's, but you can't fault the drama and passion. Neither of these sides will do particularly well. #Euro2012

surely this must be the perfect photo to kick-off Euro 2012! #Euro2012

Hey i'm good at acting, maybe i could play in the euro's #Euro2012

Promising but petered out poorly. imagine the shoddy fare when the euros go to 32 teams.  #euro2012

BBC commentary in euros is utter shit, roll on itv#euro2012

How the hell did it get to opening day of the Euros and I still didn't get the ubiquitous wall chart?! #euro2012

Forgot to post this yesterday, Russia are my dark horses to win the euros. #YouHeardItHereFirst #Euro2012

The Polish team remind me of the Russian team from the 2008 euro competition #euro2012

If all the euro 2012 matches are this good then watch out #EURO2012

#SinceWeBeingHonest Seeing #Euro2012 angered me severely because the Euro is the currency for Germany. FUCK GERMANY FUCK GERMANY FUCK YOU.

I WISH I WAS WATCHING THE EURO CUP!! Ughhh need to know the score #euro2012

Had seen Karagounis as a sprightly young kid during Euro 2004 master minding Greece's victory then ! #Euro2012 n he still soldiers on

Euro 2012, Endstand: Polen-Griechenland 1:1; 1:0 Lewandowski (17.), 1:1 Salpingidis (51.)  #ssnhd #euro2012

The Greeks have rescued this game #Euro2012 against Poland. Pity they can't do the game with the #euro

#euro2012unlike their economy, the greek football team make a comeback!!! Good opening game at the euros. 2 goals  2 red cards.

Poland end up their Euro debut with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Greece. #EURO2012

Having the euros now will make it so much easier for me to stay in at night #Euro2012

FULL-TIME: Poland 1-1 Greece. Great Game To Kick-Off The Euros! 2 Reds, 1 Penalty Saved and 2 Goals! #EURO2012

What a start to the Euros, can't wait for Germany Portugal tomorrow! #EURO2012

FT. Poland 1-1 Greece (Lewandowski - Salpingidis). Crazy stuff. This Euro is going to be great. #Euro2012

Great first match of the euros! start as they mean to go on? #euro2012

1st match of Euro 2012 over Poland 1-1 Greece #Euro2012

Well it's easy to conclude after that game the Greeks or Poles will not be winning Euro 2012. #bbcfootball #euro2012

Yes first Euro prediction has come true. Didn't I say this was going to be a draw? #smug #euro2012

Not a bad opening Euro match2 goals, 2 red cards, and offsides goal, and a missed penalty. Gonna be a great tournament!! #EURO2012

Well done Greece, good performance and should have won. Great start to the euros #euro2012

The last 4 Euro host nations (Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal) have failed to win their opening match of the tour

Poland vs. Greece 1st game of the Euro Cup. What a start!! #Euro2012

Great game to kick off the Euros. Poland should've won with their 1st half performance, but a draw was probably a fair result #Euro2012

A dramatic game to open Euro 2012, as Greece hold Poland to a 1-1 draw. #Euro2012

Good start to the euros- hopefully more games like it! #euro2012

Great opening game to the Euros. drama filled. #Euro2012

All square in Euro cup opener  Poland 1 - Greece 1 #Euro2012

All right Euro 2012'ers Mark off the first match. Poland 1 Greece 1 FT #euro2012

Good game to kick off the Euros :) #Euro2012

I enjoyed that euro game! It was pretty mental! Peter loved it too, even though he didnt know what was going on #euro2012

After Greece's performance, I can confidently say they won't be winning the Euros this time. #euro2012

Well that's my first frigging euro bet down!!#Euro2012

Jackson with a cold beer watching the Euros #Euro2012

First game of Euro 2012 is finished. Poland 1 Greece 1. 2 Players sent off, a penalty saved and some good goals. Exciting game! #Euro2012

Decent first game of the tournament. Arguably the 2 worst in it so if the rest are just as good then will make for a class Euros #Euro2012

And there is the final whistle First game of Euro Cup ended: Poland 1 - 1 Greece #EURO2012

Good start to the Euros I enjoyed that! #euro2012

Great game of football, hopefully rest of the Euros will be just as good #Euro2012

Trying to think of positives for euros in Poland/Ukraine  I've just seen 1. The females in the crowd #POLAND #Euro2012 #hotties

Greece draws! I will take all the credit for it because i'm wearing my 2004 Greece Euro jersey. #Euro2012

Seen some football #Euro2012 Greece mount a recovery - maybe there's hope for the #Euro yet!

Good game to start the euro let's hope it only gets better from here #EURO2012 #football

Well the first euro game had everything! Plenty of drama which is sure to be the main topic with these racists! #Euro12 #Euro2012 #euros

Awesome first game of EURO 2012even though I can only stream the game from the app #euro2012

If every game of the Euros is as exciting as that then I will be a happy little badger #WeStillBelieve #bringbackDudek #euro2012

The only 'Euro' I'm interested in is the Euromillions #Euro2012 can piss off

What a way to open Euro 2012! Pumped for the rest of the tournament! #EURO2012

What a way to start the euros next game is Czech Republic  vs Russia #euro2012

Good first game to kick off the Euro's. #Euro2012

Hmmm, why can't I think of anything funny to say about the Greek euro crisis?? #Euro2012

Poland remain winless in Euro Championships. 2 draws and 2 losses to their name (only previous appearance in 2008). #Euro2012

Good start to the Euro's, just hope carries on #euro2012

Pretty good opening game to the euros tbh! #Euro2012

Euro 2012 Opening Match: Poland 1-1 Greece; Game was stopped ever minute, 2 ridiculous red cards overall, very poor refereeing. #Euro2012

2 crap teams, poor ref, mistakes all over the place but still a fantastic game, that is what the euros are all about #Euro2012

Well that was interesting Plenty of action in the first match of the Euros! Fair result in the end! #poland #greece #euro2012

so the contest ends all square..!! i think the poles were lucky not to taste defeat..!! #Euro2012 #Euros

Great start to the euros. This month is gonna be a MAZING!!! #Euro2012

#Euro2012 That Game Could Have Gone Either Way. Good Start To The Euros(y)

oh you know, just your casual euro opener. 2 reds, a missed penalty, a disallowed goal. this'll be fun. #euro2012

Goals, red cards, a missed penalty - yes, Euro 2012 is well and truly here as Poland draw 1-1 with Greece! #Euro2012

Well it wasn't 2-1 but it should have. #Greece still on course to win #Euro2012 while leaving #euro.

Good start to the Euro, lots of drama already! #euro2012

Euro 2012 Result: Poland 1 (Lewandowski 17) Greece 1 (Dimitris Salpingidis 51). #euro2012

Poland 1 Greece 1 not a bad way to kick off Euro 2012 #Euro2012

Well done Greece - we'll take a point in the first game of Euro 2012! #Greece #Euro2012

Two red cards and a saved penalty highlight the game as Greece and Poland battle to a 1-1 draw in the Euro 2012 Opener  #euro2012

Big difference between euro broadcasts and US? They ALWAYS go to the hottest chick in the crowd. Like, boob closeup fosho #euro2012

Great start to Euros except for refereeing he was awful #euro2012

they way not be the best teams in the euros but it was a good opener #EURO2012

Good game to start off the euro cup #euro2012

First sub keeper to save a pen in euro history #Euro2012

No disrespect to college baseball, but those are amateurs. Euro Cup has some of the best athletes in the world. #Euro2012

Well done Poland, that's your total points haul at the Euros doubled. #euro2012

Great start to the Euro's. Bring on the next 30 games! #euro2012

Well the opening game of Euro 2012 was very underwhelming! #Euro2012

Gutted to have missed the first game of the Euro's! Will tune into Czech v Russia, hope it's just as eventful! #Euro2012

2 worst teams in the Euros with Poland eating carp and Greece being bankrupt. #Euro2012

I wonder how many numpty goons put  in goal. Typical shite goon keeper #euros #Euro2012 #GoonerTwat

What an opening game of Euro between Poland/Greece!! Had everything!! Entertaining!! #EURO2012 #euro2012onTSN

Great first game of Euro 2012 hope there are more games like this #Euro2012

It's a shame that ref can't ref every euro game, he had a great game #MOM #Euro2012 #Poland #Greece

Going to go out on a limb here ;-) : Neither Greece nor Poland will win Euro 2012.#Euro2012 #fb

It might not be the World Cup but the Euros know how to do entertainment. Who said Poland v Greece would be dull? Erm, not me! #euro2012

Right - football over - now you can vote in the Indie Music Euros!  #Euro2012

Not a bad start to the Euro's. I've got a feeling there is going to be a record number of red cards this year! #euro2012

Good start to the euros! That game had everything-goals, red cards and a missed penalty! Hope Czech Republic v Russia can match it #Euro2012

What a game to kick off the Euro's! may of just been 1-1 but some drama with the referee and penalty! was amazing to watch :D #euro2012

I'm glad I didn't pick Szczesny for my euro fantasy team. #EURO2012

So it's Poland 1-1 Greece. Great first game of the Euros! Lots of stuff happeneing in that game and a great save by the sub GK. #Euro2012

Two red cards, two goals, penalty save safe to say the Euros have got off to a flying start! #Euro2012 #FIFA #futbol

Well that was a thrilling start to Euro 2012, hope czech repulic and russia is a better game #euro2012

Euro! It only happens once every 4 years! Treat yourself to some world class soccer. #Euro2012

ITV's Euro introduction is scary. Those dolls are terrifying #euro2012

Euro 2012, Go England. lower expectations=less pressure=more wins, right? #Euro2012

Feeling vaguely smug with my office Euro sweepstake - Germany  Portugal. #Euro2012 #pretendingtolikefootball

Lets see if this Russian team can be a dark horse in this years euros! #euro2012

What is this music that ITV are playing for the #euros It sounds like a Disney theme tune! #Euro2012

get out of here euro cup is so much better #Euro2012

Yeno the whole dramatic/intense feel that ITV are trying to give the Euros? Yeah Adrian Chiles ruins that #euro2012

Prediction went wrong.. #euro2012 #euro Poland 1 - Greece 1

Why did ITV get the Spitting Image crew to do the opening credits for their euro 2012 coverage. Bit weird! #euro2012

ITV's opening titles thing for the Euro's is pretty crap, looking forward to Russia against the Czech though.. #Euro2012

I support France for this Euro 2012, they won't go pass 1/4 finals tho. #euro2012

Here we go then, the first Euro's game on ITV with all the wanker pundits and commentators. #Euro2012

Szczesny made a mistake but i bet during the course of the Euros he makes a lot more fantastic saves then he will mistake

Euro 2012 starts and I'll be supporting Croatia. Based on having most of them in my Panini sticker album #euro2012

What a creepy opening to the euro's by ITV! #euro2012

I enjoyed the opening match of Euro 2012. #euro2012

I first thought of that Greece-Russia-orthodox gag on Euro 2004, so it MUST have originated with me. You're welcome. #euro2012

Typical, Greece leaving things unsettled. Greece earns 1-1 draw against Poland at Euro 2012  #Euro2012

Not watching anything to do with the euros, hacking racist bastard countries mostly Poland and other select eastern euro countries #euro2012

Love it when the 1st match of the euro's fucks up your bet! #EURO2012 #POLAND #GREECE

Euro fever! Great opening game, gonna be some drama me thinks! #euro2012

#Euro2012 - don't care the weather outside , I'm staying in and watching the Euros

So much for not doin any more bet in the euros, im already twitchin here to do 1 on the Russia game! #EURO2012

So far my fave thing about #Euro2012 is the slow-mo shot of Casillas celebrating Spain's Euro 2008 at every commercial break. #hot

Poland and Greece play to a 1-1 draw in the opening game of Euro 2012  #euro2012 #soccer #poland #greece #draw

Spain was my favorite to win the EURO but not without Villa and Puyol. Now I pick Germany to win. #EURO2012

Adrian Chiles is going to ruin my Euros.  Bring back Des Lynam! #Euro2012

So for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine ITV has decided to use the music from the Russian film Peter and the Wolf. Well done ITV. #euro2012

odds on Vieira and Keane scrapping in the ITV studio before the Euros end? #Euro2012 won't take bets, #keano

Can't believe I am stuck at work and not at home watching the euro cup :(. #Euro2012

Poland looks lovely in the promo shots on the tv! Wasn't mad on Krakow when I was there, but Id love to see more! #Euro2012

Not really feeling the euro's, too much racism bullshit going on. #EURO2012

well trance and a euro cup football game is a great combination ;D #TATW #Euro2012

good opener.  so far the sexy euro soccer mullet count is at 0, but it's way early, so i'm not worried.  #euro2012

Remembers when Jaap Stam marked Jan Koller at Euro 2004, it looked liked twins playing each other  bring back Patrik Berger #euro2012

England winning the Euros is about as likely as Michelle McManus needing a rape alarm. #EURO2012

A contest of strength and skill where national hatreds thrive and the winner takes all - it should be called the Euro. Oh, it is. #Euro2012

Good opening game of Euro 2012, thought that would have had 0-0 all over it. Open attacking football. Poor ref, may it continue. #euro2012

Arshavin made himself a star at Euro 2008. He owes Steve McClaren a lot of thanks for that mind you! #euro2012

A contest of strength and skill where national hatreds thrive and the winner takes all - it should be called the Euro.

pumped for the euros #Nederland going all the way #oranje #euro2012 #hupholland

And so Euros begin today and they started off with a draw. Well lets see Russia and the Czezchs. #EURO2012

Euro Cup and World Cup summers are always the best. Good times watching the matches with friends at #Euro2012

Routine for the next 24 days: 1. Wake up. 2. Go to school. 3. Get home and watch two euro 2012 matches. 4. Go to bed. #ItvFootball #Euro2012

fell asleep and missed first euro match. thats dedication right there. then that seemingly bleak opener turns out to be a banger! #euro2012

Wanted: a new home for the whole duration of the euros! #euro2012

Time for the next euro game to get underway #EURO2012 #herotyme #questforthecup

Why can't the BBC just have Euro 2012 no breaks and a better pundit team #Euro2012

I think Russia has a great chance of winning this one!#EURO #Euro2012 #Euro2012

#Euro2012 STATS - 2 players from the same club [Dortmund] have produced a Euro opening goal for the first time

I'm backing the orange army for the euros as foe England quarters would be acceptable but I'm not gna hold my breath on that!! #Euro2012

#Fact:Last time Coach #DickAdvocaat led his team (Dutch) against the Czechs at Euro '04, they lost 3-2 after being 2-0 up. #Euro2012 #Russia

Will Greece stay in the Euro's or Eurozone longer? #Euro2012 #footballvspolitics

Russia v Czech Republic!!! Should be a good one! #Euro2012 #Euros ComeOn Tomas!!!

Lost my first bet of the Euros, had Poland 2-1 Lewandowski to score. Russia -1 for this match #EURO2012

Arshavins been shite all season at Arsenal, watch him have a screaming game  tournament now in the euros #Euro2012

God brought forth to this planet the Smart Phone so Justin could watch the Euro Cup whilst at work. #HistoryDoesNotLie #Euro2012

Ugh too much football. I can handle 1 game in the name of Euro 2012 but 2? Really? #euro2012

Actually not too interested in the euro!? But my support obviously goes to England!! #Euro2012 #England

The euro makes life a little better #Euro2012

I've been working on a Euro themed campaign for 4 months and now it's finally tourney time! #Euro2012

The best bit about the euros is that men take over twitter no shit trends about Justin beiber and shit like that #euro2012

Although, I'm backing Czech Republic. They were my team in Euro 2004 and I'm going to stay loyal. #Euro2012

Russia vs Czech Republic now I love the euros #euro2012

Given the huge comic potential, I'm shocked there aren't more #euro2012 jokes about John Terry/racism and the Euro currency crisis.

I didn't even know Bruce willis was in management, let alone at a tournament like the Euros #Czech #Euro2012

I hope arshavin scores because he is in my euro's fantasy football teeam #euro2012

I hope Arshavin plays like he did at the last Euro's, he was untouchable #Euro2012

Arshavin. let's see if he can shine in the Euro's #Euro2012

Come on Russia beat the Czech cunts. Robbed us of a place in the Euro's. #euro2012

The red just give the little lad a euro and said no piss off i got a game to ref #euro2012

Plenty of drama in the opening game of the Euros. Looking forward to Russia v Czech Rep #euro2012

Loving the Euros!! Football all night long, just the way i like it! #Euro2012

Also what are the odds on ITV messing up this euro's and going for a break during play #EURO2012

Euro 2012 second game Russia v Czech Republic, fancy Russia 3-1 but Baros to score for the Czechs #Euro2012

#Euro2012 Hey all euro loveR. Follow n mention to know about EURO 2012

Game 2 of the euros loving it already hope this game is a as gd as the first one #Euro2012

I am really looking forward to UEFA EURO 2012!! I cheer up to Cezch, especially Rosicky. #twinglish #euro2012

Just googled and found out that Baros was just 22 when he was highest goal scorer in Euro 2004. #Euro2012

Game 2 of the euro cup lets go! #Euro2012

Good start to the euros, Poland impressed 1st half, Greece came back well, fair result. Hope the ref is sent back to Spain tho #euro2012

Euro 2012. Ladies, Support Your Country -  #moretvicar #euro2012

Almost time for the next match. Shall cheer on Czech Republic as we saw them in Portugal in Euro 2004. #euro2012

First game was full of action, second game I think 2-2 #Czech #Russia #euro2012 #Euros

Definitely a little bitter that Turkey didn't qualify for #Euro2012. Euro 2008 was an amazing experience when Turkey got 3rd.

Far to many commercial breaks in ITV's coverage of the Euro's #Euro2012

KO in today's 2nd #EURO2012 game. In 2008 Russia were EURO semi-finalists, they begin their challenge this time against Czech Republic.

the seconed game of the Euro 2012 is about to start russia vs. czech republic #Euro2012

#Euro2012 Welcome to Wroclaw, where Russia kick their Euro 2012 campaign off, playing in all Red, and the Czechs are playing in all White.

Van Basten thinks Russia will win the Euros!Dont know him as predicter, but what a great striker he was.Best in my time#Euro2012

Van Basten thinks Russia will win the Euros!Dont know him as predicter, but what a great striker he was.Best in m

That was a great game to start off the Euros #Euro2012

I hope when they convert our marks to UMS they take into account the Euros were on #ThereOnlyAlevels #Euro2012

The 1st Man Utd player as finally appeared at The Euro's, hello Howard Webb!! #Euro2012

#Euro2012 : Przemyslaw Tyton (Polish GK) is the 1st GK ever to save a penalty at the Euro Champs and Salpigidis

Win an England shirt signed by one of the Euro 2012 squad #euro2012

I recall this match finishing 3-3 in Euro 96! No mention from ITV about that. Perhaps didn't want to remind Southgate. #RUS-CZE #Euro2012

These early EURO games are great, but tomorrow is when the real fun begins. NED-DEN, GER-PORT. The Death Group. #EURO2012

Vladimir Smicer scored at Anfield when these two met in the group stage at Euro 96 #RUS-CZE #lfc #Euro2012

I know it's the #Euros but I'm still really surprised #SlurAlco released #HowardWebb for the tournament. #Russia #CzechRepublic #euro2012

#Euro2012 Greece has more euro wins than England, Italy has more World Cups than Germany but everyone wants to play like Spain.

Just set up twitter for the euros #euro2012

This euro game is very whistle bound. I didn't expect one at the freaking kickoff. #Euro2012

I remember being at the Russia v Czech Rep game at Euro 96. 3-3 belter! Could do with that again here! #EURO2012

In Euro 2008 #Arshavin was the player everyone wanted, in #Euro2012 hes the player no one wants #careerdownthepan

After experiencing Martin Atkinson's goal line decision making first hand, I can't believe he is now at the euros #euro2012 #blindassistant

Many World cup/Euro winners have the spine of the squad all from the same club side (e.g. Zico's Brazil and Xavi's Barca) #euro2012 #russia

great to see Howard Webb refereeing the Euro game #Rotherham #Euro2012

Still, hard to like Russia after they drug-cheated us out of Euro 2004 #Euro2012

Euros have been good so far! Russia are sick!! #euro2012

Arsenal made the mistake of buying Arshavin after a good #Euros, think history might be repeating itself shortly. #EURO2012

To me it seems #Russia is really up for this Euro  #Czech seem to start attacks but can't complete the process, must get settled #Euro2012

Exams during the Euros. Just my luck. Medicine takes sacrifice. RIP #Euro2012

What? The father of one of the current Czech team played at Euro '96? I was there! Fuck! I feel old. #euro2012

Already more goals this opening day than last Euro. Only 3 then between the two games. 4 today with Russia looking to score more. #Euro2012

Frustrating watching Arshavin. Could have been so good. The biggest example of a confidence player in a long, long time. #euros #euro2012

#euro2012 Best irish euro team man for man ever:? 87 v scotland: bonner whelan mcgrath moran mccarthy lawro brady galvin houghton stapo aldo

Thank God for the Euro, I was having a football withdrawl. #Euro2012

Poland v Greece. First game of the Euros: score 1-1. That's red cards and goals. #euro2012

For the worst group of the euros the first 2 games have been pretty decent #Euro2012 #goodstart

How long does Euro 2012 last?  Snooze  #euro2012

Russia rampant. Paliychenko (sp?) makes it look like Euro 2008 all over again. 4-1. #Euro2012

They've always said to not mess with the Russians! Dream start to their Euro 2012 campaign; 4-1 with 10 minutes to go #Euro2012

Russia could have a chance at the Euros if they play like this every match.. #euro2012

Great finish! Good start to the euros! #Euro2012

Euros have been good so far ,even though second half of Poland-Greece match was so boring IMO,but still Gr.A has the baddest teams #Euro2012

Great way to start euro 2012 with a 2-0 day, btw dzagoev will be a name that will be rmembrd for yrs to come. Hes an abslte star #Euro2012

So Russia has a chance to do the same thing like their previous Euro, become surprising team #Euro2012

I've remembered why Euro 2008 was so good. It was the lack of England references shoehorned into every single game #Euro2012

Friend referred to Spain and the Euro situation. He wasn't referring to football! #Euro2012

Check my timeline for crazy #Euro facts! #Euro2012

#Euro2012 So the Russians looked good, though the Czech's haven't been any good since since Euro'96 and they haven't replaced Nedved.

2 real good games to kick off the euros lets hope tomorrow games will be just as good #euro2012

Counter attack masterclass from #Russia. #Arshavin immense. Euro 2008 part 2. #euro2012

Hope they get rid of the Euro flowers during replays as they tend to cover the players' faces - a tad unmasculine? #Euro2012

This Euro ball seems SHIT for free kicks #Euro2012

#Holland well on top of #Denmark so far but #LFC's Agger is playing well #euro2012 #euros

Holland cannot win the Euros with Robben in the team. Will cost them opportunities with his selfishness. What a prick #euro2012

Rugby doesn't do it for you.. We have the euros on in the coxswain Netherlands v Denmark #EURO2012

Watching Holland is what the Euros are all about #officiallystarted #Euro2012

Jetro Willems is the youngest player in the Euros? Perhaps everyone has forgotten how old Rooney was in Euro 2004. #Idiots #Euro2012

Mad as fuck that I'm getting paid to sit and watch the euros #Euro2012

Not to impressed with the refs in the euros so far.. Way to many fouls being given for soft challenges. #euro2012

It's #euro2012 for TSC has Euro 2008 sleeve badges. Fake's just another word for replica.

My tip for the Euros is Germany. Dutch look too wasteful and certainly not the strongest defensively. #euro2012

Go on Denmark. I love the Euros. #euro2012

That's what the euros are all about. #Euro2012

There it is, that's why you've got to love big competitions like the euros! #Euro2012

Netherlands 0 - 1 Denmark - Euro 2012 - Group B #Eurosport #soccernews #dutch #euro2012

So excited about the Euro Cup! #euro2012

This is what the Euros are about, thisreminds me a bit of Romania's gutsy performances in the same position 4 years ago #euro2012

Danish soaked up the pressure and out of nothing are leading this game. 1 - 0 Denmark. Euro 92 all over again?? #Euro2012

Watching the Euros with Dad and a beer in my hand, perfect Saturday afternoon! #Euro2012 #Danishwithashocker !!!!!!!!

Told my dad Denmark would take the lead! Wish id of banged a tenner on it. Also predicted Denmark to win as well! #EURO2012

I reckon ze Germans should take the euros bit it won't be easy #Euro2012

Oh wow the Euros keep on giving #Euro2012

As if I'm gonna be able to revise with the euros on!! #euro2012

Euro technically doesn't start till 2:45 today that's the game that really matters today #Euro2012 #goodmatchup #portugalforthewin

Denmark with a goal to the good 1-0.  Denmark with the confidence #Euros #euro2012

The Netherlands taking a Barcelona type approach to Euros possession, passing, losing.. #Euro2012

Bet on Holland to win the Euros, but got Denmark in a sweepstake. Hmm. #Euro2012

Still say this arbitrary streak ends today. #Euro2012Denmark has never lost a EURO game when scoring

If someone waltzed past me like that in my amateur game id be hooked. 1-0 Denmark #euro2012

utterly useless goalkeeping so far in the euro's.#Euro2012

There will be so much surprise in Euro 2012 XD

Wow Denmark. Would be good to see a few upsets in this Euros. Hope Portugal go through the group and do the Germans later  #Euro2012

Denmark have never lost a Euro game when they've scored first. 5 wins, 4 draws. #Euro2012

Finally get to watch the euros properly. Should be a good match now Holland chasing the game. #Euro2012

All over my twitter newsfeed is the Euro thingy, don't want to see it I'm not watching it #Euro2012

these euros are totally unpredicatable-spain, germany, france, italy and england could all win it, love it with no clear favourite #euro2012

Come On Netherlands!!Dun embarrassed the Dutch!!Holland can even do better than you!!Hehe#Euro #euro2012

The #dutch have to win today or the euro will begin sucking quit early #Euro2012 #ClearEuro2012

Grateful for twitter to inform me that the Denmark match is on already. I thought Euro football was an evening thing #euro2012 #emdk

Netherlands got scored on by Denmark. Lol this euro is so unexpected! #euro2012

There was mention of them as the ultimate underdogs of Euro finals football in the aftermath of the goal. #Euro2012

Whatching tha euros with well gutted holland are a goal down. Fuckin denmarks! #euro2012 #tits

Having to buy a tourny pass so you can watch the euro at work.. #dedication #euro2012

Will you 2 be doing any Red Button commentaries for Euro 2012? Quality last time!!  #euro2012 #BBCSport

Jonathanto compare prices, don't give the ticket prices in Euros and the wages in dollars. Pick one currency! #Euro2012

Video: Holland 0-1 Denmark [Krohn-Dehli] #Euro #euro12 #Euro2012

Just realized that the time in Poland is +2 GMT and in Ukraine is +3 GMT and I am missing the Euros #soccer #euro2012

Id really like England to win their group and Ireland to take second in their group so they can play each other in the next round #Euro2012

I think a lot of peeps underestimate Denmark.Often overshadowed by Holland, but aren't a weak team. Especially in Euros.#Euro2012

Robben still looks to be haunted from that Champion's League final. #NED #DEN #Euro2012 #euro12 #euros

Euros just a different type of tournament, no less important. Very harsh. #euro2012

WTF is this BBC #Euro2012 on about comparing wages in dollars, ticket prices in euros and milk in Stirling. Totally useless comparison.

torres top goal scorer for euros #euro2012

Wonder why the euro's doesn't have country flag hash tags? #euro2012

Robin Van Persie the Right Man for Juve?  #juve #juventus #netherlands #euro2012 #euros #vanpersie #RvP

You needed to score that robben! Your in my euro dream team!#Euro2012

Germany is so going to be the champions of Euro . #EURO2012

A Denish goal stuns the Dutch ! Here's a fact. Denmark have never lost a Euro game when they've scored first. 5 wins, 4 draws. #EURO2012

If you don't watch the Euros or World Cup something is wrong with you or you're just a simple minded asshole. Best tournaments! #Euro2012

Day 2 of Euro 2012 - my predictions are a 3-1 win for Holland  a 3-2 win for the Germans.I support Germans#euro2012

I hope so to dude, started well but Robben doesn't know how to pass and Van Persies going to have a Euro nightmare! #Euro2012

The score should be completely different, great game though!:-) Loving the Euros at the moment! #euro2012

Who are the most inked up nation at the Euros? The Danish centre backs love a tattoo. #EURO2012

Love the fact euro is on bbc, no adverts! #Euro2012

A very interesting first half in the game, I wonder if there are going to be any half time subs for #NED? #DEN up! #Euro2012 #euro12 #euros

Euro 2012: Denmark lead 1-0 against Netherlands at half-time #euro2012

Halftime = Denmark 1 - Netherlands 0. It would be so epic for Gordon Ramsay to call a Euro Match! #EURO2012

Another good game in the Euros. Enjoying the full out war between Van Persie and Dan Agger #Euro2012

Euros have been brilliant so far..but you just know England are gonna ruin it tomorrow. #Euro2012

All the music they play on the euro 2012 broadcast is Coldplay #EURO2012

Watching Euro 2012 , been waiting for this. Go Denmark! #Euro2012

Wtf is up with Netherlands they need to step it up or else they won't get no where in this Euro #Euro2012

I hope so to dude, started well but Robben doesn't know how to pass and Van Persies going to have a Euro

Good to see my tip for the euros (Holland) have started well. #euro2012

I feel like Euro Cup should invite the team and let us win each time because of our role in WWII when we SAVED

The last time Holland failed to score in a Euro Championship match was the semi final of Euro 2000 - A 12 match scoring run #stats #Euro2012

Holland defo won't win the euros.. Awfull defensively! #Euro2012
