Good night, UK. Stay mad! Hope we will be still one country tomorrow #indyref

Presume there are a team of UN observers in Scotland. Never trust them Sassanachs :) #indyref

At the parliament. A hundred yes voters and 3 noes, guess where the cameras are? #indyref

Kind of curious to see what will happen if Scotland leave, but, politics aside, I don't see what they would gain from it. #indyref

I look forward to the inevitable stories about how more people voted for The X-Factor than in the #indyref

This is gony be one long emotional night #indyref

No 54 Yes 46 in final YouGov #IndyRef poll this morning - but important to bear in mind that this is based on their panel, NOT an exit poll

One thing is very clear to me - trusting young people with the vote is a GOOD thing. We should follow suit for General Elections #indyref

What a buzz this has been ! now for the long wait too excited to sleep !#indyref #YesScotland #YesBecause

Glasgow looks like a laugh though #indyref

Then again, maybe they'll extradite Edith Bowman #indyref #VoteYes

I Love England  love my English family  I also hope Scotland gains its independence  #whatsupwiththat #indyref

It's starting. The quarter of me that is Welsh is already lobbying to secede from the English bulk of me #indyref

YouGov #indyref Poll: YES 46% and No 54%.  All the latest news and views on   Join the conversation #hppindyref.

Please tell me exist polls are bollocks? #indyref

Err ENGLAND vs Scotland?! I think it's that type of arrogance that has made half of Scotland want to split! #indyref

Always a problem with the fucking teuchters isn't there? #indyref

Exit poll in my flat is 3 yes and 3 no. Suspect this reflects the country at large. #indyref

1800 people polled. Hardly representative of 4.5 million people! Probably right though. #newsnight #indyref

Regardless of what happens tonight/tomorrow, at least we gave it 110%!!! Thanks #indyref

The boys are clearly excited about tonight #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

LIVE STREAM NOW  George Square as Scots vote in independence referendum #indyref #ScotlandDecides #ScottishReferendum

#indyref Live coverage from George(Independence) Square,

What's the score with Jackie Bird's 'platfom'?   how come she's seated above the talent? #indyref

#indyref Scotsman Google Hangout discussing YouGov late poll showing 54% No and 46% Yes

Yougov polling company calling a no vote of 54% #indyref

One #indyref Polling Station in a hall meant a yoga class couldn't meet. They weren't bothered. Bent over backwards to help.

Feeling anxious for the Scottish as they follow the count and await the #indyref result.

Sorry but I think we're sticking together. #BetterTogether #IndyRef

99% certainty of a No win says a YouGov pollster on #Newsnight #IndyRef

If Scotland votes Yes, then your gonna regret your desicion to leave #indyref

I'm kinda hoping that Scotland votes yes and then the whole country just floats off and joins Greenland #indyref

Huge turnout. Regardless of the result, a great day for UK democracy. The challenge; to replicate the numbers in future elections. #indyref

I'm off to bed soon, remember if its a draw I'm expecting a dance off. Preferably huge Scottish  English flash mobs please. #indyref

The votes are cast and now the count begins. #voteYes #indyref #scotlanddecides

10 minutes in and it's all going tits up already #Stornoway #indyref

Peter Kellner of Yougov calls it for the NO voters, by 54% to 46%. #indyref

Brilliant #indyref speculation interspersed with Northern Soul to keep us going! ff

Reports of 100% turnout in some areas of Scotland - THAT'S passionate civic engagement! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Early signs that Salmond has been smoked #IndyRef

Not long for Scotland to decide if they want independence. George Sq is full of yes voters. Party atmosphere that could turn ugly. #indyref

The final YouGov poll has been released. I'm going to miss all those polls, even the cheeky rogue ones.#indyref

YouGov survey poll #indyref 46% yes, 54% no (not an exit poll)

Projections for each of the 32 councils will appear on this twitter feed as the night continues! Turn-out is high, 85% to 90%. #Indyref

UGOV man has been smoking crack or something 54%NO #yes #indyref

I just really hope for a yes vote. Scotland needs to have its own say in how the country is run #indyref #YesScotland

Peter Kellner of YouGov making a great point - the higher the turnover, the easier to predict the outcome. 54% No - 46% Yes #indyref

So, 38 minutes since the polls closed and nobody has a clue what's going on. Were there tallies kept at all today? #indyref

lol, Most trusted MT #indyref Truly breaking news: Both sides in #Scotland ref get majority

Will I have data roaming charges in Canterbury if there's a Yes vote? #indyref

There was always going to be a last minute 'No' swing as people bottle the prospect of fundamental change #indyref

#indyref my opinion poll ?  We won ! SCOTLAND !!!!!

Problems with the count in Stornoway. Aye, anything above ten and they are fucked.#indyref #VoteYes #localissuesforlocalpeople

Results night supplies for tonight, all I need now is an embarrassing Alex Salmond interview and we are set. #indyref

A 99% chance of a No vote, says Peter Kellner of on #indyref

Well, bedtime. Let's see if I'm still a subject of the Union in the morning #scotland #indyref

No exit polls tonight, but a re-contacting of voters by polled NO 54%, YES 46% #indyref

getting lots of love and a few thousand likes and shares tonight.  #indyref

Latest YouGov poll places 56% voted 'no' and 46% would have voted 'yes' #indyref #ScotlandDecides #news

Early reports suggest the #no side will win out with 54% compared to 46% #indyref

These are 2 of Scotland's 32 local authority areas, right? #indyref

So much for the early bed  early rise #indyref plan. Can't sleep #waytooexcited

We had this one chance to get rid of Scotland, and it looks like we've blown it #indyref (just kidding Scotland)

I think it'd be fantastically ironic for us, in the event of independence to just empty every rocket trident has on Scotland. #IndyRef

BBC Scotland Sky 101, BBC Rest of UK SKY 954 #indyref

See showing no visible remorse on Scotland Decides for his shocking twitter outburst earlier. #indyref

mum just told me the falkirk polling place closed early cos 100% turnout; all who could vote did before 10pm #indyref

It would be interesting to see an #IndyRef result without biased media coverage and a cultural and political onslaught from Westminster.

Health warning: that last is not an exit poll #ScotlandDecides #indyref

do u have high hopes for this #indyref

fwd: Tonight's YouGov #indyref survey is not an exit poll

'The Final Countdown' just came on in this pub.Apt. #indyref #Scotland

John Redwood talking weirdly about English and Union parliaments, as if both can exist simultaneously #indyref

Who knows what will happen tomorrow-I can tell you what will happen tonight! #indyref #HP25

So, Yes campaign, you might have lost but at least you tweeted well. #indyref

I just can't wait to watch video with their #indyref Scotland vote musical medley - come on - upload faster please!!

Those red/green graphics on the BBC are going to give me hallucinations #indyref

For those who want to stay up all night, you can watch the #indyref results come in, live, here

Not finding the prospect of waking up to hear the #indyref result exciting like most people

YouGov's final poll on #indyref in #Scotland predicts 46% Yes and 54% No. First results come in after midnight in the US

I forgot my address when I went to vote at 7:30am oops #indyref #VoteYes #yes

Good times when ur pal changes to vote yes #indyref

TowerHamletstan has voted 113% Yes to Scots independence on a turnout of 109%.  #IndyRef

If you want Edwards and Burley-free coverage, switch to BBC Parliament. #indyref

Just added an #IndyRef column to my tweetdeck. It's rolling so fast, my head is spinning.

YouGov exit poll is actually a survey of previously surveyed people. Though it gives an indication. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Kay Burley being her usual dreadful, provocative, plastic self. Had to switch off. #indyref Scotland, please keep her. Awful woman.

YouGov's Peter Kellner tells he estimates 99% chance of a No victory. Spoiler alert, dude. #IndyRef

Don't know how much of the count I can take. Tranquilize me  #indyref

Expert saying it's a NO in the #indyref. While that means a smug Cameron tomorrow, I'll take that over a future UK dominated by the Tories.

Looks like you're staying with us Scotland. Sorry mate. #indyref

Can't we extradite him to a cuise ship somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle?#bettertogether #letsstaytogether #indyref

[Insert Karl Rove joke at appropriate time] #indyref

Adam Boulton looking happy, he clearly wants a no.  #indyref

#indyref They may take our lives but they'll never take our desire to be free to choose our future. Democracy in action as #ScotlandDecides

Pulling an all nighter to watch the #indyref on the BBC. Wish me luck

#IndyRef coverage from BBC1 Scotland streaming online now:

alarm set for 6.15am. Will definitely not be hitting snooze tomorrow morning, determined to see the result declared #indyref

Any way to sign up to get alerts of results throughout #indyref ??

#indyref The exceptional turn out shows the world how much we really care.The result shows the world the kind of people we really are.

Odds for No vote have shortened massively in last hour. Is that cause of Yougov poll or something more? #indyref

There's something sublime about that period between a probabilistic event's determination and when its observers actually find out. #indyref

You better have said #Yes #Scotland! I need an excuse to have a wee dram. #indyref

#indyref 1/20 NO odds- I don't have to comment on that sort of price

The nation's media are here tonight to see the #indyref count take place #ScotRef2014

Here I am, sticking the knife into the salmond en croute #indyref

Peter Kellner says its 99% certain than No have won #indyref

Ballot Boxes being diverted from Stornaway Airport to be delivered by boat instead due to foggy weather #indyref ^A

Same people asked in yougov poll as in previous one ie it isn't a random sample it's a sample which already declared for no  #indyref

94% NO chance. It's all over bar the shouting #indyref

Jackie Bird is raging she's not on the telly. Photobomb!!! #indyref

I tell you what, if Yes win than opinion polling should cease to be a thing entirely #indyref Bookies will be mega out of pocket too

Let's be honest the only thing I really wanna know is who wins the sweepstake #indyref

Is the Queen busy packing up the silver at Balmoral just in case? #indyref

Tomorrow begins a new chapter in Scotlands history, unite behind the result. Runrig - Morning Light:  #indyref

If the referendum is tied, does Louis Walsh get to decide? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

All these Scottish accents on the news are just lovely. #indyref

YouGov says 'can't see no losing this now' #indyref

we pulled out of the British  Irish Lions eight years ago but nobody noticed. #indyrefallnighter #indyref

It's going to be at least 5 hrs before figures start coming in. Why are people calling it a win for No already? #indyref

has Mel Gibson come out in favour of either side yet? #braveheart #indyref

any one else in England hanging around to see the first results come in? #indyref

#indyref bit ironic, if the aye vote wins what will the website be??? .co.scotland?

If #YesScotland win then it would appear that social media can undermine mainstream media support for #bettertogether in #indyref.

I'll divorce you if you change the channel. R We're done here. It's NO. What else is on telly? #indyref #Scotland

Yougov guy on Sky News coverage reckons 99% chance that No has won this! #indyref

Oh look, Gordon Brown! Didn't he secretly call Labour voters bigoted four years ago? #indyref

Ahh there you go. You had one job #indyref

I feel legitimately sick waiting for the result. Don't think I can sleep. #indyref

You'd think in this day and age we can't come up with something better than pen and paper #indyref

#indyref  I'm saying come 6am its going to be a NO

Scotland poll 54%-46% is quite wide apart. Did the No campaign gain that much traction in the past week? Let's see end result #indyref

Not very often you will go to sleep in on united country and could wake up in a separate country! #scotland #UnitedKingdom #indyref

Does Alex Salmond fall through a trap door if they lose? #indyref

Not sure I'll be able to stay up all night given the outcome is already known and I have to be up early tomorrow #indyref

yougov say its predicting a win for the no vote  with 56% #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Oh no!! Hue Edwards?!! Where the fuck is Dimbleby?? #indyref #bbcindyref

Possibly the best cartoon yet on the Scottish #indyref  via

Everyone's been talking about the Polls today..what's up? Have they taken more of our jobs or been invaded by Germany again? #indyref

John harris' body language on #newsnight is a bit awkward #indyRef

Wanna watch the referendum streaming on BBC iPlayer but you're overseas? is your friend. #indyref

And if anyone is wondering, the picture I posted two tweets back is George Square as of twenty minutes ago. #electric #indyref

#Scotland however you voted, all our lives will change in UK. You have resurrected political engagement. Thank you  good luck! #indyref

I've decided to take this evening to keep half an eye on the #indyref and sort through my images from me American

Kellner says 10% of Yes voters found to be unreasonable. Does he mean unhinged? #indyref

nobody wants to go to sleep on Twitter tonight for fear of what 2moros result will be. Never known a political vote be this close #IndyRef

Couldn't find any #indyref stuff on the telly. Just as well my shitty hotel has France24.

Come at me #indyref. I've got you covered.

Would Sporran McJock please make sure he locks up when he leaves #indyref

Tedious #BBC #indyref programme  we're only a few mins in. It's going off.

Very quiet from - worried that they are working on how to put a positive spin on No #indyref

David Cameron's arsehole will be gon ten to a dozen the night, shiting his pants incase he looses us!! #indyref #shittingit #VoteYes

Wouldn't be a vote night if didn't have a graphic #indyref

Sitting watching our futures unfold with a caramel log and a dog with no teeth #indyref #indyrefallnighter #counting

If scotland does vote yes, I suggest they make peter capaldi their king. Then I beseech them to invade the UK and liberate us. #indyref

watching the referendum result, doubt ill last all night #indyref

Setting my alarm for 6am. Merry hackmas everyone #indyref

Remember where you heard it first: CNN nails the #indyref result   -  astonishing mathematics, well done CNN!!

Yes, No or bed? Bed has massive majority #indyref

Scotland has voted. The United Kingdom of Great Britain  Northern Ireland is made of 4 amazing parts. Hope it stays #indyref #bbcindyref

Yougov say it's 99% certain it's a no vote. Until tomorrow #indyref

Going for results show - insufferable already and is a consummate pro. #indyref

Let's wait for the real poll - only a few hours now.#indyref

#indyref What a day. So enjoy tonight.Cheers everyone#ScotDecides

Peter Kellner on says he's 99% certain on a NO win in #indyref. Head agrees', heart still thinks there's some twists to come

First ballot boxes have arrived in Dundee and the count is well under way. #indyref More:

I now have 350+ in my Scotland list  Feel free to share for independence vote news. #indyref

I wondered how the BBC would fill 3+ hours of air time before the #indyref results. Turns out that it involves life-size CGI submarines.

BBC Scotland or BBC1?? How do I decide? #indyref

Staying indoors this afternoon due to the smoke. Means I can read about the #indyref while everyone else is asleep at home though. #KingFire

Oh, the BBC coverage has Jeremy Vine *switches to ITV* #indyref

I wish that I wasn't feeling so unwell, so that I could stay up as the first #indyref counts roll in.

If Cameron ever fancies a trip to Vegas, I'd be happy to join the party. Balls o' steel, that man. He's a gambler, if nothing else. #indyref

not really much point staying up all night for the #indyref result, i could go to sleep and be up in time for the announcement

It's nice to see reps from both sides talking positively about each outcome on TV, rather than shouting their gobs off. #indyref

YouGov have called it 54-46. But can you beat the pollsters? Send us your #indyref prediction (to one decimal place). Prize for the closest!

Our brilliant political editor is poised to give his analysis of the #indyref results on #ScotlandDecides - laptop and all!

Fatuous and tasteless graphic on bbc of a giant nuclear submarine. I hope they've voted #yes on that basis alone. #indyref

On reflection, 1800 likely voters from Yougov is probably good enough. What'd be more shocking is of that poll were *wrong* #indyref

Now the #indyref is over one thing is clear - better history teaching in schools both sides of the border must be a priority.

RUMOURS CONFIRMED that Jeremy Vine and Michael Bay collaborated in the BBC's #indyref coverage. #cgitastic

I'm surprisingly more tempted to go sleeping than staying all night long awaken for the #indyref#GettingOld

Hope the #indyref is a draw. Want to see Alex Salmond and David Cameron settle it with a penalty shoot out.

Garmouth hasn't seen such activity in years. Time for a wee dram to pass the night away.  #indyref

Two of my former PhD supervisors James Mitchell and Rob Johns #scotlanddecides #indyref

Best holiday day I'll take all year tomorrow. #indyref

BBC has apparently chosen the theme from Drop the Dead Donkey for its Scotland Decides programme. #indyref #irony

I'm hoping this 54% No isn't true tbh #indyref

Do I go to sleep? Do I stay awake? Do I go for a jobbie? Do I fight my mum? What do I do? #indyref

I'm guessing 70% No vote. The silent majority are in the No camp. #indyref #bettertogether

Breaking: English reaction to the Scottish #indyref Yes vote

I wonder if we stop being an island nation than we may collectively feel a bit more European? #indyref

I might just live tweet my dad's reactions to the #indyref coverage. They're gold.

Should I be at the federal courthouse for class? Yes. Am I there? Nope. Watching #indyref coverage on via

Borders set to return a strong NO VOTE! Well done My Borders #IndyRef #VoteNo #BetterTogether

#indyref This has been far from a democratic experience.If we are left under the Westminster Jackboot then every #no voter should be ashamed

I don't know if this is deliberate but No counters are mostly wearing suits, whilst Yes counters are more informal #indyref

This is so close. Both sides seem confident in a narrow victory. #indyref

Did Ruth Davidson just confess she'd had a sneaky look at the postal vote? #ScotlandDecides  #indyref

I started of neutral but over the days I have joined the yes camp for reasons too long to go into on twitter #indyref

It's okay for me to go eat toast  watch now, right? Nothing crazy is gonna happen while I'm gone. :-/ #indyref

Head of Yougov says 99% certain No has won. Confident considering complete lack of precedent. #indyref

Looking very calm and orderly at the count hall just now.Whereas in every other building in Scotland people are going batshit crazy #indyref

Just did an interview with Radio New Zealand. Even though they have a general election on Saturday, the talk is all #indyref.

Ignore any shite from anyone claiming to know anything at this stage. #indyref

Based on YouGov 'exit poll', seemingly. Same org which first put yes ahead, causing panic in London,Westminster,  City #indyref

The one person in Fiji who cares about #indyref and other hashtags :)

either way, Gordon Brown has been pretty magnificent, which I wasn't expecting. #indyref

Interesting BBC Alba has a documentary on a village in Laos on the brink of getting electricity !!!Am I fecking missing something? #indyref

I wouldn't go by opinion polls on sky news. A poll of 3000 people turned out 54 no  46 yes and he says he's 99% sure no will win #indyref

I feel like such a grown up when I watch Sky News #IndyRef

That's a thought. It would be like 'celebrities read mean tweets' but 'politicians read random #indyref tweets from bored scots'

YouGov, the pollster, has just come out with its final poll (not an exit poll, by the way), which predicts a 54-46 win to No. #indyref

#indyref wow.. woman on bbc just pointed out that there will  be no britain if they vote yes.

It's been a privilege to take part in democratic discussion in this historic event. Whatever the outcome, Scotland must be proud. #indyref

Scotland has voted, it's still too close to call but what did twitter say #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Why is the BBC showing two different programmes for #indyref Scotland decides? BBC One and BBC Parliament different content for same thing.

SCOTCEN POLL OF POLLS has No at 52% and Yes at 58% - No! That's what it says! - eh?  #indyref #Scotlanddecides

According to CNN the Scottish referendum has had an astonishing turn out of 110%! Oh, America #indyref

Good luck to Huw Edwards he has to stay awake for another 7 hours for this #indyref result show. I hope Scotland has decided to stay.

Huge drift with the bookies on yes vote. 10/1 available now #indyref

Stay up late or get up early? Telly or Twitter? Yes or No? So many decisions! #indyref

Pundits are predicting 54-46 for No on #indyref based on exit polls. Would Scotland choose to keep the 'Great' in Britain?

Today we made history together, tomorrow let's move forward together, regardless of the result #scotland #indyref #voteyes #voteno #exciting

Whatever the result Scotland have been outstanding this week!!! Great country either way #indyref

I'm saying no, just should've said it months ago, and at Ladbrokes with a tenner in my hand #indyref

Just driven back from work at BBC Scotland to Carlisle. Full of cold, tired, cats have brought a mouse. How late can I stay up?  #indyref

#indyref Long night ahead: the Scottish Independence Referendum Result Will Be Announced Like This  via

Sky News going all American  have called the vote already as No 54 Yes 46.B4 single result.Hope they get it well wrong.#indyref

BBC start coverage by suggesting 54/46 in favourite of No #IndyRef #Scotland

To all my pals North of the Border, I hope you get the result you hoped for. It's been quite a ride, but we still hope you stay! #indyref

I was confident of a #Yes vote then I turned on the BBC #indyref

When you vote it's between you and the ballot. It's a very intimate, albeit brief, relationship. That is why I never rely on polls. #indyref

So is anyone even slightly surprised at the exit polls early #novote predictions? Was NEVER going to happen #indyref

I'm nervous. On this sort of turnout polls are irrelevent. #indyref #bettertogether

Goodnight Scotland! When I wake up it will be in either an independent country or not. Either way it remains a great one #indyref  #night

Scotland, if you vote for independence today, I want to be appointed the U.S. Ambassador to Scotland. #please #mayI #indyref

Scotland, I don't care if you stay or go as long as you don't walk 5000 miles to be back at our door #indyref #ScottishIndependence

No exit poll, right that's it im banging babe station on #indyref #indyrefallnighter

follow scottish referendum all night. and then you'll be so delirious that whatever is bugging you won't! #indyref

Working through the night to watch the #indyref vote.  Will be interesting regardless of which way the Scots swing!

Lol love the way told us there wouldn't be an exit poll! :) #indyref

No exit polls for the #indyref - my reaction be like

I can't find a single channel worth watching. #Scotland #indyref

What channel should we be watching? #ScotlandDecides #indyref

LIVE: Wake up with us early tomorrow - we'll be bringing you the #indyref result and all the Worcestershire reaction

waiting for Archie gemill to jink his way through East Lothian. #indyref

you should of adked #Peterkellner if he will resign if he is wrong #indyref

He should have been knocking doors all day. It's not looking good for him #indyref

So nervous. I hope to wake up in an independent country. #indyref #yes

What an amazing picture of O Connell street the night Ireland became a republic #stunning #feelingpatriotic #indyref

Sorry but calling Andrew Marr 'Andy' is not cool. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

1/2 Nearly home after long  busy day. Looking forward to a big bowl of Rice Krispies  #indyref coverage. Or porridge  sleep.

ITV have Johann Lamont, BBC have Against type, I think I'll go with the Tories tonight! #indyref #fb

#indyref #Scotland the enormity of #yes -what will happen in the international markets  how that affects Eng Wal  NI is unfathomable

Is that correct, Huw Edwards saying an exit poll wasn't possible because of size of poll? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

How is Mary Pitcaithly so laid back? Very impressive #indyref

Polls have closed in Scotland. Who's staying up all night to watch the vote count?! We are in NYC! #indyref #YesScotland #yes

Betfair market now implying 94% chance of No victory. #indyref

First resignation call for Cameron on Newsnight - that was quick #indyref

The big question on everybody's mind is: who did the Telephone Sanitisers vote for? #indyref

Goodbye YouGov if you've got this one wrong, MT YouGov predicts a 54-46 #indyref win for No

So counting started in #indyref. Hope the decision is to stay together. 300 years of shared history isn't something to lightly cast aside.

If betfair is anything to go by, it looks like #nothanks for #indyref. It reckons only a 6% chance of #YesScotland.

Peter Kellner says he is 99% sure No wins - 54/46 whatever happens the political landscape has surely changed significantly #indyref

MT close turnout is 80-90%. Working class vote in huge numbers. Higher the turnout better for Yes #socialistscotland #indyref

When will the media and the politicians realize that this #indyref is not about them but about us?

I don't think Andrew Marr has ever been to a #PolFed tea dance.#indyref

So thinks that the count centre at the emirates hosted the cycling at the commies. I think not. Try badminton! #indyref

Winners - Salmond, Brown, Sturgeon. Losers - Cameron, Clegg, Milliband regardless of outcome #indyref

Since August 5th, there's been 1.55m uses of Yes campaign hashtags in tweets vs 500,000 pro-No hashtags #indyref

Isn't it easy to look really, um, slow on Twitter. Oh, yes #indyref

I shall be on ITV's Good Morning Britain from Edinburgh on Friday morning to discuss all things #indyref.

Hey, who are the 3% who didn't vote? #indyref

That's a hell of a call by YouGov given that there's no precedent for an exit poll. #indyref

She is going to announce the result: Chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly #indyref

Hold on,Glasgow ISN'T the capital of Scotland? Well you learn something new everyday.Anyway Scotland great to have you in the union #indyref

#indyref YouGov poll - 54% No, 46% Yes. Looks like a No then, :(

Understandably so of course, but Marr is definitely a yard or so off the pace these days #indyref

I'm really starting to think Scotland is going to say Yes. #indyref. Going to be here all night watching it come in with

Got home from work at 10, and Gran has the kitchen set up for an #indyref #allnighter the fun's not over yet #ScotlandDecides

BBC not doing exit polls for the #indyref, might this be a cunning plan to make us stay up all night to hear the results?

This #indyref is actually a lose-lose for people like me. If it's a yes, I have to listen to Scots go on about something I don't care about

There is a tendency to treat the #indyref as a vote about Scotland's fate. It's a constitutional issue about the UK.

With poll of 1800 ppl showing 54-46 for no, I'll say its a yes. #timestamp #indyref

Shock #indyref news - Scotland already recognised as independent by international bodies. Enquiry launched into FIFA, CGF, IRB, ICC, AFL

polls are polls and results will be results. waiting and watching how the #indyref will turn out

If you're waiting up for #indyref results to come in, listen to the new album to fill your time. It's fantastic

Only reason I want a yes vote is because I backed a 60+% turnout with a yes vote. #indyref #9/2

Had deliberated about doing an #indyrefallnighter, but I'd rather sleep. The result will be the result in the morning.#indyref #Scotland #UK

Just turned on BBC and it all feels a bit like Eurovision night.. Or is is just me?  #indyref

Looks like a night of intensive #indyref don't see myself sleeping for a while!

you delightful bastard. From this first bit, arguments are over. Discussion and conversation prevails. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Gotta love Jeremy Vine and his green screen #indyref

Hashtag insight from 1. #IndyRef 3.75m2. #VoteYes 1.1m3. #Scotland 439,0004. #ScotDecides 272,0005. #BetterTogether 224,000

It's all about Jeremy Vine and his graphics on election nights #BBC #indyref

if it's a yes, how long will Scotland have to wait to join eu. Trade damage will be irrepairable. #?work permits #indyref

My colleagues and I at the #maybe camp are really hopeful about tonight's result. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Done! Now it's going to be a sleepless night waiting for the results - feels like Christmas Eve! #indyref #bebrillianttoeachother

Anyone else think they should've got Tess and Claudia for this results show? #indyref

Am assuming you guys are having a late one?! #indyref

Jeremy Vine confirming once more that we won't know the result until the result is actually announced. #indyref

Edinburgh counters in high-vis 'look like a police confederation tea dance', according to Andrew Marr on #indyref #referendumbanter

Vote counting begins in Scotland on independence #indyref

They keep going on about how important this thing is and it's the first election I can remember without an exit poll #indyref not so crucial

BBC Scotland's map only includes geotagged tweets, but still useful for a glimpse at what people around the world think about #indyref.

I bet Sunderland is SO angry it can't declare first #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Misty weather means fishing boat may be needed to help #indyref ballot boxes get to Stornoway from Benbecula  don't sink

Surprising that no reports of booth capturing or names not being on the polling list from Scotland. #indyref has been a tad dull.

Jeremy Vine building up to the shittest game of Deal or No Deal ever. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Earliest #indyref declarations are expected at around 2am on Friday. Edinburgh  Glasgow at around 5am. The latest is expected at 6am

#indyref I'm hoping and waiting. The thought that a certain occupant of no. 10 might be shitting himself puts a smile on my face.

If it ends up 50/50 does it goes to penalties? #indyref

As a fellow St Andrean, and fellow Scot, I share your sentiments. #indyref #IVotedNo #No #ScotlandDecides

Clicked on trending #indyref tag expecting talk re: the officiating during the game. Hi, I'm Tracie, and I'm a little slow sometimes.

Jeremy Vine channelling his inner Peter Snow here. #indyref

Saor Alba!? or Shackled Alba?!:  via  #indyref

It has to end tonight remember, might go to pens. #indyref

I wonder if any of the polls questioned the opinion of Jim Trott from The Vicar Of Dibley? #indyref

Yeah turning on the tv before bed was a bad idea! Not sleeping now! #indyref

Can anyone tell me what it's like at George Square? Long's the party gonna go on for? Fancy joining in. #indyref #VoteYes #Scotland #Glasgow

seven hours  no exit polls?? hmmmm think imma duck out  catch results early tomorrow morning instead #thesuspense #indyref #yesplease

Jeremy Vine is scary enough on Radio 2 at lunchtime. His gangly limbs on late night BBC1 might just force me to switch off #indyref

I really hope that Alex Salmond went in to the polling booth and voted no, just to have a wee chuckle to himself #indyref

I'm tuned in from the United States. I hope for good things to come from Scotland #indyref

So, from what I'm understanding of the BBC coverage, Dundee might be independent but Edinburgh not. #indyref #newbelgium

I'm hearing Don't Know have lost their deposit #indyref

BREAKING: results to be announced via LED sheep display just before dawn Friday         #indyref #ScotlandDecides

enjoying the sound of democracy.   Polls close, George Square:  #indyref #Yes #Newsnight

Is Kirsty Wark broadcasting from Prison? #newsnight #indyref

i dont understand why people think its a great idea to vote yes #indyref

97% voter registration. 90% turnout in Dundee. 80% in East Lothian, not counting postal votes. Scotland, we should *all* be proud. #indyref

The YouGov poll was only taken by around 1,800 people. Fairly small sample for electorate of nearly 5 million, no? #indyref

#indyref forecast no vote as its 1/20 on with bookies. What do they know?

Is this a political storm happening over #Cardiff tonight? #indyref #allchange

I really need to sleep but I'm too worked up #indyref

Watching BBC coverage, they're pulling out all the stops in trying to figure out a guesstimation #indyref

This yougov stuff underlines the ridiculousness of not holding any proper exit polls. #indyref

I wonder what the man from Del Monte is going to say?#ScotlandDecides #indyref

My timeline now - Scot ref, Scot ref, iOS 8, iOS 8, Scot ref, Scot Ref, lightning storm, iOS 8, iOS 8, Scot Ref. #ios8 #indyref #lightning

I remember 2011 Holyrood results which no poll seemed able to predict - on 55% turnout, nevermind 90%. Short memories, pollsters? #indyref

No need to wait up - the bookies have the answer for you. It's NO #indyref

Beautiful! And a nice change from the nailbiting politics of #indyref

Have 10am class tmrw but really wanting to stay up all night to find out the result. #indyref

#YouGov exit poll says 54% No, 46% Yes. Exit polls rarely far off the result #indyref

Nice to see patrick harvie paying attention this week. #indyref #BigBigDebate

The feed is too slow. Where's my exit polls! Channelling my inner Josh Lyman here. Where's my Joey Lucas?! #WestWing #indyref

I really fancy a haggis and whisky supper right now #indyref

I hit the streets of Scotland this evening to capture some #indyref flavour. Found this chap. #ScotlandDecides

Stovies a la while waiting for the #indyref result #veganmofo2014

Lovely little Groundhog Day package on #Newsnight. Ah, the Beeb, it's only great. #indyref

What will happen to all those people called Blair after #indyref results? Will they be re-homed with new political campaigns?

Don't forget the Yes campaign have an away goal #indyref

The votes are cast, and now we wait.  Will the United Kingdom remain united? #IndyRef

good luck anyone reading that tonight #indyref lol

agree - with both parts of your statement #indyref

What's the fuss about #indyref on this island about? explains to non-brits:

Scotland, don't do it man. It's not worth it. Stay with us. #indyref

Love to know what thinks of Peter Kellner's polls and statement of certitude. #indyref

What Would Denis Law Do? #WWDLD #indyref

Am I gonna go to sleep in one country and wake up in another? Ahhhh exciting times ahead. #indyref

That's all for the #indyref special. Sorry I couldn't tweet all submissions.Normal service will resume tomorrow.

didnt even think the broadcast would go further than scotland #indyref

The East Renfrewshire #indyref count is in full swing. High School

. That's one of the #indyref bingo cards marked then.

Whatever tonight's result, I hope we recruit some of those Yes campaigners for the pro-EU campaign. Definitely made the running #indyref

#indyref independence is not about the snp clue is in the title ?

Jeremy Vine on #ScotlandDecides 'Councils by Birthplacepeople born there  stayed there'Otherwise known as the inbred-o-meter!#indyref

YouGov's Kellner is VERY confident of a No victory #indyref

How many different pronunciations of will rock out wi tonight during the #indyref result? I'm plumping for 6.

I can't leave, Jeremy Vine has an election graphic #indyref

No side seem very happy tonight #indyref

Don't think our hands are entirely clean. Think #CSAinquiry will need to have reach in Scotland, post #IndyRef

#indyref Got it. *light bulb over head*. Bed and all night.

Thanks. Should be OK tomorrow -- I'm not planning on staying up for the #indyref results :-)

Utterly unconvincing explanation on about lack of an #indyref exit poll. Huge disservice from all involved.

I don't care what country, of whether it's local / government but I love watching the election results come in. This one looks good #indyref

I'm pretty sure all the recent photos I've seen regarding #indyref have been of big halls filled with boxes. Box factories.

i love this expert - his top lip doesn't move while he talks. #indyref

Why hasn't voting come into the 21st century  being done electronically - we'd have an answer already! Suspense is killing me! #indyref

82% turnout is encouraging. Referendum is once in a lifetime chance so people should grasp it as it's their chance to have a say. #indyref

#indyref I've election night envy at size of BBC coverage operation. We need to upscale our efforts for May 2015

Why am I so nervous, I'm not Scottish #indyref

100% turnout at one ballot in Angus. Bloody hell. #indyref

Whatever the result, Scottish democracy kicks serious ass! 97% voter registration and record breaking turnout. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

My piece in on the lessons from #indyref.Short version: don't answer 'yes we can' with 'No, you can't'

If only you voted yes, then your vote would count for something at every election. #IndyRef

Time to settle down for the night and watch a bit of history. #indyref

The next big media event will be the bloodbath as splits into its incompatible component parts. Can't wait! #indyref #Scotland

It's nice to see the getting some tv time  #indyref

Even Curtice is nicking my Sunderland tweet now;)#indyref

Going to sleep, and let's hope it'll be a resounding no in Scotland's #indyref when I wake up tomorrow.

Mentally exhausted but proud to have represented #BetterTogether at Fountainbridge Edinburgh despite all the threats of violence #IndyRef

Lots of discussion about what the outcome of this referendum might mean for Scotland. But what will it mean for referendums?? #indyref

If Scotland vote yes does that mean that it's still 70-odd years since Britain's last Wimbledon champ? do you know? #indyref

My mum just sneezed so hard that she peed. #indyref #scotdecides

Given that there aren't any results yet, I guess the rows of analysts are just playing minesweeper right now #indyref

Never before have I seen Huw Edwards so excited#bbc#indyref

If #indyref brings greater devolution to local government, we'll all be winners.

Yes camp not looking positive at the moment in Edinburgh West count area. Postal votes 9:1 against according to one activist! #indyref

I've just pulled a marvellous bogey from my nose. Report that, Edwards. #INDYREF

Do the SNP and Alex Salmond still have a mandate if Scotland votes no? #indyref

Trenchant analysis on the activities of the Queen during the #indyref :

I have political butterflies in my tummy. #SexySocialism. #indyref #VoteYes

Today was the most emotion I've ever felt at a polling station. Things are not going to be the same again either way #indyref

If it's a yes vote then good luck to themif it's a no vote great we're still a United Kingdom #VoteNo #VoteYes #indyref

I'm not expecting to need flashy graphics  neon tv set during analysis on #indyref

Change is coming for Scotland says Danny Alexander. Change is coming for Danny Alexander, says Scotland. #indyref

So in the event of a No vote and the Vow policies being rescinded in Westminster  - does that leave revolution? #indyref

Grassroots are *sinister* to wee twee #indyref fuckers who want to keep us politically inactiveThey think it is THEIR game, not ours

BBC meta tagged #indyref tweet  .. kind of cool

Feels like Scotland in the Argentina World Cup already! Hope so much that the Yougov poll is wrong #indyref

I vote I will wake up with Scotland still a part of the UK. If I don't I will eat my socks #indyref

Kirsty Wark and Danny Finklestein talking as if independence is a goner. #indyref #newsnight

In Numbers: How many tweets have been sent about the referendum? #IndyRef

in the absence of an exit poll, are the Skellingtons giving you anything on the #indyref ?

As we say in Glasgow maybe's Aye, maybe's Naw. #indyref Whatever the result, I hope and pray for unity afterwards.

Off to bed. Alarm set for 3am. Give me a nudge if anything exciting happens before that! #indyref

Fog in the Western Isles delaying the delivery of their ballot boxes. Damn you, fog!!!! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

as long as the YES team don't put on an illegal sub in the 86th minute of the second leg. HH. 30000 vote deduction #indyref

No matter what the final result actually is, I think there will be a very different feel to the country post #indyref

Highest voter turnout in a UK election today since 1951! #IndyRef

Complete faith in Mary Pitclaithy and her team, sending them lots of energy and thanks for all their work tonight #indyref

Really hoping YES vote carrys the day in Scotland. Either way, great to see true democracy in action. #indyref

You did all you could mate. If this fails it is purely down to the last week of fear. #indyref

180 people hard at work counting Fife's votes. Only 385 ballot boxes to get through! #indyref #ScotDeclaration

I really hope you did the right thing Scotland! Absolutely buzzin! #yes #indyref

It seems to me Scotland's vote is a ballot between fear and hope. Fascinated to learn the outcome this evening. #indyref

Call me when it's over. Going for a run, and then a pint. Count 'em. Democracy at work, love you even more either way #Scotland. #indyref

Of course #newsnight is talking about the West Lothian Question saves em talking about and to the people in Geroge Square  #indyref

Can only see one result for you guys and it's a 'no' unfortunately! #indyref #ScotlandDecides #ScottishReferendum

Stuck for an #indyref soundtrack to listen to until the count coverage really gets going? Here's a handy playlist.

History in the making? Whatever happens the outcome will leave many heartbroken.  UK will be changed whatever #indyref

Hopefully Wales don't follow Scotland and demand for an #indyref, I wouldn't want the UK to risk losing Huw Edwards

Vans are now queuing up to drop ballot boxes off for the Edinburgh #indyref count #ScotRef2014

Chin up, Catalans. This was never about you ;) #indyref

I kind of like the idea of Scotland going their own way and choosing their own destiny. For better or worse. :) #indyref

Tonight I will show my support to our fellow celts by doing what Primal Scream told us all to do #indyref #ScotlandDecides #RocksOff

This is exciting! Voted at the #indyref and awaiting the results It will be a very long night. Might wake up in a new country tomorrow!

#indyref #newsnight What about intimidation by big business  banks  their threats? #TUSC

#indyref  for the sake of my future, and the future of my children. i want them to grow up in a scotland that fought for freedom and won.

I really hope we're taking back what is rightfully ours - ALL OF IT, not just part of it, ALL OF IT. #IndyRef

The Yes vote was doing really well until Vivien Westwood joined in. #indyref

I wonder which sad looking photo of Alex Salmond the papers are going to put on the front pages tomorrow? #indyref #itsano #freedom

Western Isles result to be delivered by fishing boat! Good on ya! #indyref #VoteYesScotland #ReferendumLive

I suppose after tonight #SNP will have to get back to doing what we actually pay them for: Running our country #indyref

I don't like this waiting-its going to be a long night#indyref #Scotdecides #pleasestaytogether

Dundee likely Yes! Sky News #indyref

Massive thunder and lightning storm over Cardiff tonight. Speak more clearly please Celtic Gods. #indyref

Gonna stick with it for a while and see what happens but I think it's gonna be interesting what news we wake up to in the morning #indyref

RT have No on 52% and Yes on 58%. Well done Scotland, 110% of Scots voted! #indyref is it the English in Scotland

listening to you now live in Toronto! #indyref

The current thunder and lightning in Cardiff is definitely adding to the sense of drama. #indyref

Non-#indyref TV thought: Huw Edwards hosting main BBC coverage points to 2015 general election being David Dimbleby's last gig :(

you liars are responsible for this , murphy should give you 10 per cent of his 200 grand expenses. #indyref

I would point out that the end of #indyref campaign means the return of Ed Balls.

Where's Paul the Octopus? Surely the #indyref is tailor made for him

Watching the #indyref coverage on BBC with in hand. Would love to be in an Edinburgh pub.   #ScotlandDecides

I've forgotten the name of the lady on Newsnight #indyref, it will come to me

It looks like Gordon Brown has saved the Union - I hope will be saying thank you #indyref

Whatever happens I will always be British #indyref

With passion like this, I can totally understand the Yes vote as scary as it is. #indyref  (HT )

Need to go to sleep, I'll catch up with #indyref in the morning!

Huw Edwards does not know social media #indyref

This is it Scotland! Whatever the result, you've been phenomenal.  The rest of us could learn from youexcept the Tories, obv #IndyRef

I think it's now safe to say as an English, yes leaning, lefty,  Alex Salmond is a monumental twat. #indyref

My prediction on Scotland? I think there'll be an awful lot of unsold face paint tomorrow. #indyref

I know I should be interested in #IndyRef but I'm more concerned about getting a new iPhone tomorrow! Are t queues gunna be awful? #probably

Still don't understand why the rest of the UK didn't get a chance to vote?? #scotlanddecides #indyref

RT Sources say that a U2 album has been found in each ballot box opened so far. #indyref

No matter what the result you will still have yourself and your neighbours to life with #indyref

That last photo far from representative. Mood around Holyrood building is positive, calm and anticipatory. #indyref

I'm finding it upsetting that Dennis Canavan has been wearing the same oddly coloured shirt  trousers for weeks now #indyref

I've genuinely no idea how this is going to go! It's been such an interesting and historic campaign to watch. #indyref

74% yes vote on can see you through kay burley's top on sky news. Is she trying to make saltire with white bra? #indyref

You're kidding. This is the actual #indyref ballot?  via

Looks like the Ayes don't have it. #indyref

Deeply concerned why democracy is being applauded, the biggest decision to affect the future of my country and I don't get a vote #indyref

#indyref based on a 32 council result? ..I'm no statistician, but any way you look at the result it must be skewed? Majority of 4.3M votes?

Nice to see the tensions between Yes and No pages seem to have ceased now we have done all we can do. A good sign of things to come #indyref

Barcelona supporters were flying Saltire flags at the football tonight. #indyref

Mum got me a present to commemorate the #indyref Says a lot about her as a person ;)

Anyone genuinely going to sit thru the hours of utter drivel until any kind of result emerges Be careful, take regular breaks. #indyref

I'm guessing all this thunder and lightening is a sign #indyref #scottishindependence

The awkward bbc coverage is making me cringe. Waiting for someone to start singing karaoke to fill the time. #indyref

Bookies 1/20 for No and sky news reporting Westminster relief ! Hmmm strange boxes have just been opened.  #indyref

BREAKING NEWS - Ballot boxes have arrived at the count - the desperation of rolling news #indyref

agreed. There are many such larger existential questions. #indyref

#Indyref sitting watching news in anticipation! Long night ahead! Voted for the first time today! Come on scotland! Yes!!

#BBC is pulling a #CNN tonight with a giant virtual submarine in their #indyref coverage. pure entertainment

The Loch Ness Monster.He says 'YEEEEEAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!' #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

If Scotland vote yes, drop down menus will be so much easier for them.  #indyref

Anxious, nervous, excited, only 8 hours to go #indyref

Yes or No, tomorrow leads to an English Parliament for England! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I hope that's not supposed to be comforting. #indyref

Just want to know the result now! #indyref

I really like Alastair Carmichael. Gent. #indyref

Most opinions seem to be calling that the NO vote has won #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref not as much twitter fun as the commonwealth games opening ceremony (sad face)

#indyref  wants to control it's own future. What benefits will the offer Scotland on Monday? It's a win-win !

Just realised the papers are up the #indyref creek. With no exit poll and no announcement til breakfast they have no story to print.

Tea, coffee and Tunnocks Teacakes. providing us with what we need to get through the night #indyref

watching the #indyref is like watching the golf or snooker - hours of steady pacedness, nothing exciting

Almost home from work STV or BBC!? #indyref

Off to bed. Sinking feeling that the No side have prevailed but who knows what the morning will bring..#indyref

MT This French Bulldog Puppy learns to jump.  #indyref #notindyref_but_good_distraction

#indyref Can't watch coverage. Huw Edwards is only presenter who hates looking into camera. #bringbackdimbleby

Who just wants them to get on? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Very confident Scotland have voted no. Lost all respect for Hope he doesn't represent #BetterTogether #IndyRef

Even if it fails this timein the long run is an independent Scotland now inevitable?  #indyref

#indyref tears on way to poll station duties, stunning views of the Cuillin, thinking Scotland you can do this, we really have to do this.

#indyref watching the BBC coverage - better on the BBC England

Peter Kellner seems certain of a No vote.. Let's hope he doesn't feel awkward tomorrow.. #indyref

As a proud Scot not allowed to vote my x would have been on the NO. #indyref

The #indyref has really got people interested  talking about politics again, that's what's most important.**(Top UK Trend: clitostorus)

I can't do this anymore the suspense IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS EVE!!! #indyref

#VT National guard jets made a Saltire in sky this eve! #indyref #Scotland the world is with you!

''There is no way of knowing, in which direction we are going'' Willy Wonka #indyref

Amazing graphs  graphics on the #indyref vote count broadcasts. Unless you're colourblind.

Yougov poll described as 'exit' poll. Only in sense they contacted people already on their books who had voted. #indyref

Can't wait to hear the results.long night ahead #indyref #yes #independencescotland

Morning is going to be weird!! Almost wish I was off tomorrow #waiting #indyref

Off to make a sandwich. Can't believe I didn't get haggis in for tonight. I fucking love haggis. #indyref

That sounds like an amazing night doing tequila shots and discussing the Barnett formula #indyref

I understand no exit poll, but did they really not have anyone counting voters at least?! I could have organised that. #indyref

Still 0-0 on Sky News. Good game though. #indyref

i think i will put Terror of the Zygons on the other TV for ironic effect #indyref

Jackie Bird looks like she's straight oot ae trainspotting #indyref

Has spouted her usual daily irrelevant shite yet - today's theme being #indyref no vote?

The real question is how Groundskeeper Willie feels about #indyref for Scotland.

Time for bed,let's hope we still wake up in the United Kingdom #indyref

I hope the Turnout figures of 85-90% in the Scottish #indyref are replicated across the UK in the 2015 General Election #NoApathy4Change

Was aiming to get to sleep at 11:00, then wake up at around 5:00 to catch the result of the #indyref but I can't see myself dropping off!

The students are out in Manchester, it makes me feel old. Mainly because I'm looking forward to getting into bed  watching #indyref.

So THAT's how you push for independence! Where are the riots? Burning cars? India can learn from this. #indyref

Will you be purchasing them from the foreign foods aisle in future? #indyref

This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands. #IndyRef

Turnout figures tonight showing that voter apathy is down to political parties not engaging with the issues which people care about #indyref

#Indyref Castlemilk votes apparently 'very high.' Obviously back early from the South of France this year

Predicted 84% turnout on - beating Sweden's 83% turnout for their very well attended national election. #indyref

Fog delaying results from the western isles in #indyref. Amazing.

No one cares, but if you b really want to know, I voted yes. #indyref

Not really bothered what Scotland vote tbh, it is good to see the turnout percentage so high though! #indyref

89% turn out it Clackmannanshire #indyref record breaking figures

predicts high turnout in #Fife #indyref says all but 60 voters had cast their ballots at one Dunfermline ballot box by 9pm

To every last #No voter in Scotland today, an eternal thank you #indyref

Is all this true? If so, it does seem to puncture this particular #indyref argument

We've just handed out huge amounts of pizza and it's almost midnightWe. Cannot. Wait ! #indyref

Orkney turnout is 83.7%. Edinburgh postal vote turnout is 89.6%. Excellent numbers! #indyref

Now with a new map. Our #voteyes vs. #NoThanks maps of #indyref available here:

I like learning about all these places I've never heard of #indyref

Turnout figures are incredible considering optional voting. Unsure whether that's good news for change or the status quo. #indyref

What's everyone's money on? A Yes or No Vote? #indyref

If I wake up tomorrow and there is a majority No vote, I will be absolutely raging. Expect riots. #indyref #YesScotland

First turnout figure comes from Orkney at 84%. Huge voter turnout. #indyref

Voting for  permanent change is not as easy as people would think. It's always a big gamble and the risk is heavy #indyref

Be careful Scotland..if it's 50/50 Louis Walsh gets to decide #indyref

Turnout in upper Port Glasgow est over 80% and Larkfield in Greenock close to 90% sources tell me #indyref

Massive turnout in Dundee, expected to give a big YES vote. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I'm bemused by surprise at high turnout. A referendum on a country is not comparable to any election. #indyref

#indyref South Lanarkshire council has reported that the counting of the votes should be ready by august 2017. Last council to call award!!

Some terrible paper sorting tekkers on display in Clackmannanshire there. #indyref

Want to give a shout out to Huw Edwards, hosting the #indyref show with great humility and kindness. Wish we saw more during the campaign

Why can't democrats in Britain find a single station that is not a poisonous Tory propaganda machine? #Scotland #indyref

So it looks like Proud Edwards Army isnt going home tae think again. #indyref #Scotland

Not going to bed till I see the first results. It is currently 00:18 #indyref

#ScotDecides and his self-publicity drive an embarrassment.  Ed hopeless when whites of actual public eyes nearby. #indyref

After #indyref, shd UK have constitutional convention as proposed 2 yrs ago by ?

suppose #indyref goes like 51.2 YES and 47,9999999999 NO. will it be a majority forcing a minority out of Britain?

Checked back to 1997 referenda - Orkney turnout was well below average in those. #indyref

The horses have really swung it for the Neigh campaign #indyref

shameful that you essentially describe yes people as bad and no as good. #indyref

Maybe I am missing something. 80% turnout is heralded as unprecedented. Let's be clear - this is not a by-election in Huddersfield #indyref

Thanks for everything you have done over the campaign. #indyref #VoteYesScotland

Incredibly impressed with the turnout across Scotland. History truly being made at the moment #indyref

I like to imagine the votes trucks are like driving over exploding bridges and getting shot at #indyref

We all speak the Queen's English #indyref #scottishindependence

The results draw nearer. Watch it unfold on #WakeUpLondon from 6am. Here's Keith Mills on the #IndyRef

Is it because this matters more, or because it's potentially as good as irreversible #indyref

The big dilemma - now glued to news on #indyref but staying up much later will make morning run before final #nhf14 sessions less likely

Four different boxes - labelled Yes, No, Doubtful and Rejected - have now been brought out at #Renfrewshire count #indyref

I'm glad I've not had to make the choice for my grandchildrens lifetime today,but hope when I wake up we're still #bettertogether #indyref

Closely following the development of the #indyref . It's YOUR future Scotland!

#indyref results expected in the morning?! I forgot how astonishingly slow vote-counting is in the UK

You've got to give it to #Scotland #indyref Fantastic engagement  turnout in politics. If this was UK wide perhaps things would be better!

Why are people saying that the #indyref turnout should be an example for those who don't vote in local/general elections? Seriously??

I think on this occasion a comedy boaby, so long as it's clearly in one or other box, should count as a valid vote. #indyref #SexyX B.B.B.xx

Accident on the A9 has delayed some of the highlands count. This is why it should be dualled. #indyref

Why are national election result nights always so exciting??? I feel like a kid again!!! #scotlanddecides #indyref

Can't get over how historic this is. What an incredible voting turn out. This is a lesson in democracy #indyref

Dear PM, #indyref We want our identity back please. The priority now is not Scotland but the formation of an ENGLISH PARLIAMENT

Razzle-dazzle aside, it's interesting seeing women, young people  people of color featured in this #indyref broadcast.  ty

#indyref Sky News filling time by repeating nonsense on a loop, jazzed up with animations and a twitter ticker #news #notnews

Either way, the world will be impacted. This issue is important. The 90% turnout should speak for itself. #indyref

Should have stocked up on Tunnocks Teacakes in case we have to import them from now on #indyref

Will a yes vote have a dramatic effect on the cost of Rumbledethumps? #indyref

What should you do if your spouse is about 48% minded to divorce you? Just asking, y'know. #indyref

A quick lunch at the Rabbie Burns Hotel. 1230. It's the right thing to do. #indyref

Quite impressed by high voter turnout of #indyref. Wonder if Japan would be like this if we had a big turning point.

poll of 1800 people, which equates to 0.04% of the registered voters means it's 99% that no wins#indyref

Check here for #indyref results (but probably not for another 5-6 hours or more):

96% turnout, BUT WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE POST OFFICE! #indyref #debate

Sent a reporter to a Scottish pub for a colour piece on #indyref. He's back at 7:35 pm. The business has changed.

East Lothian predicting a result by 2am. BT reckon that sampling is suggesting that No votes could be over 60%. #indyref

#indyref Interesting development BBC cites Salmond cancels going to Aberdeenshire count will go to Edinburgh directly sounds ominous for yes

I spent one year in corby. My thoughts are there. Good luck with #indyref #greetingsfromgermany

With #Scotland saying #NO to independence, the Constitutional battle for whole of #UK   especially #England will begin in earnest.#Indyref

#IndyRef far from foregone conclusion especially as turnout may include more disenfranchised young  working class votes than polls predict.

Okay, seriously I've only been watching sky news for ten minutes now but are they treating No guys with this brazen hostility? #indyref

Feels odd not seeing #indyref stuff on most popular bets/big events on

the most disgusting reporting bias ive ever seen. Presenters totally disrespectful.  #indyref

For a laugh I would say it was a draw and need to re count just to see the looks on the people countings faces #indyref

This place is tiny, the population tiny,  yet we still need to wait until bloody 2am for a result. Off to bed. Work still calling #indyref

#indyref  So proud of the way the Scots have represented themselves to the Worldhope it stays this way when the result comes through.

Allegations of electoral fraud in Glasgow? Go'way. #indyref

This was fun, Scotland should do it again next year. #IndyRef

#indyref ticker tape on STV showing the worthies comments, surely This is what the campaign kicked against?

Waiting to hear the results of the #indyref  Politics are definitely different. Here we'd have polling estimates that would be giving info.

#scottishindependence #indyref don't think it's happening guys

Just peed. Smelled like sugar puffs. #indyref

Scotland has gone absolutely bonkers hahaha #indyref

So #indyref had nothing to do with Mike Pence?

Worth following the ultra-clever for #indyref analysis tonight.

Hennessy describes the 3 party leaders as 'tommy cooper constitution-making' #indyref #bbc

Apparently 10 voters in Glasgow turned up and were told they had already voted. Why do I suspect they just voted before their meds? #indyref

Looks like Glasgow had a higher turnout of voters than previously thought. #indyref

hey buddy. what's the latest news on #indyref?

Imagine how bloody brilliant it would b if genuine #democracy broke out in England too #indyref

the votes haven't been counted yet. Just waiting to count #indyref

Trying so hard to keep up with #indyref - the Scottish / British slang makes me need a translator haha

Irn Bru and Glens while we wait for the first #indyref #indycounts to come in

Stirling postal vote is 96.2% received. Wow #indyref #skyelections

It's incredible how many people have voted! #indyref #Scotdecides

If you want to lose interest in the #indyref watch it on the #bbc

#indyref : Falkirk postal vote Clackmannanshire at 88.6% [UK] record=83.9%. so that may not be technically relevant

Twitter is going to play a major role in the next General Election like it has done in the Scottish referendum #indyref

Adam Bolton talking down to quite a few pro-indy activists  #indyref #yesscot #voteyes #scotlanddecides

If Scotland goes independent tomorrow  they should start thinking about reducing the price of freddos to like 5p #indyref #VoteYes

Welcome to the UK political storm due to hit on the 19th September #indyref

Fantastic bbc, we're being shown the result boards even though we have no results. #indyref

MP Jo Swinson arrives at count #jpScotRef #indyref

whatever #indyref  happens, we must respect the decision of the Scots.

Orkney was where there was the highest % opposition to the Scottish Parliament in 1997, would be odd if YES won there tonight #indyref

So Dave, when you make ur big devo speech later today, be sure to remember us (for a change) #EnglishParliamentNOW #indyref

alarm set for 6am. Hope I don't miss anything too exciting #indyref

They have been predicting a vote that high for weeks. WHY didn't pollsters adjust for it?!! #IndyRef

#indyref douglas Alexander should really have a look at Labour in Scotland. Get gordon brown or darling into msp roles in scotland!

There has been serious crap posted by both yes and no supporters, and some utter drivel from people who should know better. #IndyRef

4 out of 10 ballot papers have been removed from count in Glasgow to go to police - 6 remaining  #indyref #yesscot

Yes papers in the 'No' pile in Dundee and 'supposedly' 10 fraud votes in Glasgow which will end up not counting! #fixed #indyref

#IndyRef BBC's Brian Taylor getting on my nerves - waffle waffle waffle.

The #indyref is not our 'hate' for Westminster its about our ability to choose and to be able to take responsibility for our own choices.

why do we need the 'jeremy vine' slot. Immediate switch to  #indyref

Anyone want to address the trending yes-on no vote table pics from clackmannan??#INDYREF

Is someone going to the piss out of Jeremy Vine? He's no bloody Steve Jobs #indyref

Why is there yes votes on the NO table - confused !  #indyref

What happens if votes are exactly 50/50? Need 50% +1 to win. Surely they don't draw lots like general election? Genuine question. #indyref

Gordon Brown's final gift to the Scottish people is a massive fib. Cheers. #indyref

Jeremy Vine is showing lots of the ways we can categorise we know absolutely nothing yet. Took him 5 mins. #indyref

Sky News coming good second, pacey, lively and straight to the point shoot interviews from - needed on a long night #indyref

The two sides of the referendum should be called Scotch-Brite or Scotch On The Rocks #indyref

Labour have pushed the self-destruct. How they can come back from this I don't know. New politics and new parties needed #indyref

The ugly: Scotland #indyref threatens to tear apart the UK

Going to try to go to bed then early to rise me thinks #indyref

Jeremy's so good at stringing out a complete lack of results into what sounds like meaningful discussion he should work in academia #indyref

Alex Salmond arrived at polling station with no problems. Yes thugs booed  hurled an object at Alaistair Darling. #indyref

Live: Scottish independence referendum result: 9:32am: Yes Scotland anticipating the first result cou  #indyref

It's odd.Right now, as a technical Scot, I am simultaneously two nationalities,stuck in Schroedinger's Ballot Box till the morning.#indyref

I go to bed to dream of a new country. I hope that I wake to that dream come true. #YesScotland #indyref

If the vote goes Yes then Tartan should be made illegal by at least Weds next week! #indyref

#indyref are they cheating us? Looks like a yes on the table to me!!!!!

10 accounts of Fraud  pics on BBC showing Yes votes in No pile in Clackmannanshire or Dundee! Somethings not right  its scary! #IndyRef

Come on, Twitter. Renfrewshire Urgent - what does it mean??? #indyref

Slightly nervous to go outside tomorrow if we don't get independence. Dundee are hardcore #yesvoters #riots #indyref #dundeescumdee

Why don't general elections get this kinda turn out? Cos no matter who you vote for, the government always wins. #indyref

Why haven't we had an explanation for the yes vote in the no pile??#indyref

Jeremy Vine theretaking part in his own version of Knightmare! Someone put the helmet on him and make it a bit more sporting! #indyref

Salmond not attending his own count. Read into that what you will #indyref #bettertogether

#indyref shows that voters aren't disengaged, the political parites are. Give them a clear choice and people will vote.

And yet they still haven't mentioned the yes vote(s) on the no table.. #indyref

Whatever the result, the Queen is expected to issue a statement tomorrow afternoon. | #IndyRef #TD1Live

Yeah, I saw that. They were mentioning the influence of University students in Dundee. #indyref

Party? No. Me and Kels are in the John McIntyre building in Glasgow Uni waiting on the referendum results. #indyref #VoteYes

It's going to be No. Quite heavily. You heard it here first. You can go to bed now. #indyref

You're right but the candidates must also be representative to create a true working democracy #indyref

I just want to know the results right now! COUNT. FASTER. #indyref

ManTV news really is atrocious isn't it? They've got nothing to report, but that's not gonna stop 'em. #indyref

I just like listening to Scots speak. #indyref #YES

If Scotland votes yes, then the UK will lose the dear and mysterious Loch Ness monster #indyref #independencescotland

Need to remember my #indyref hashtag. See if my tired weary nonsense can make it on the telly.

Hurry up and get counting! I'm getting impatient! #indyref #bettertogether

Imagine if there'd been referenda on the wars in the Middle East, bank bailouts, the #austerity programme, NHS privatisation #indyref

If Scotland has decided it's a No, then maybe the Yes side could just go form their own independent state, Och Aye SIS #indyref

Willie Rennie felt the swing. Kinky #indyref

I will never vote for labour as long as that patronising prick Douglas Alexander is standing for them #indyref

Seen this on Facebook no table has a ballot paper marked yes.  Was on sky news #indyref

Would love to see a #yes vote in #indyref. Join us Scotland! At least you didn't have over 800 years of oppression. #ByeByeGB

Dundee turnout 78.8%, lower than the 90% speculated  #indyref

Staying up until i know Britain is safe. Perhaps going to be a shorter night than I was anticipating :) #indyref

#indyref how long till #electronicvoting ? Good enough for x-factor good enough for #indeyref !

terrified they areesp Cameron and his clones. They will try to prevent a 2nd outbreak if NO wins #indyref

#indyref did Andrew Marr just ask whether his pecker was still up..?!

I was lucky looking forward to an independent Scotland, would've been a great experiment on the world stage. Shame. #indyref

It Wis Aw A Fix Aw Along x #indyref

#indyref Is it true that Alex Salmond is under 'suicide watch'?

Results from Orkney within the hour. Perhaps. #indyref

Omen!? Scottish #indyref: Man finds piece of KFC chicken that could be shape of new UK

check out the front of the GB passport The unicorn (Scotland) chained to the crown #indyref

If #ScotlandDecides 'Yes' in #indyref, do they too automatically become better than England at sports like football, rugby and cricket?

Everything will come down to Big Billsy Gills, Talisker St, Tullibody, Clackmannanshire. Hope he chose wisely. #indyref

Yup. And Yes votes counted as Noes. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

If we are to lose tonight, let's do so with good grace. No whining. No bitterness. No recriminations. We're better than that #YES #indyref

#indyref Remember boys - No means No! There's no point getting all shouty, abusive and rapey about it! Respect the Lady's wishes.

I look up #YesScotland and see thousands of proud Scots having voted #Yes. I look up #NoScotland and crickets. #indyref #VoteYesScotland

#BREAKING via the BBC: First results likely to be announced in the next 30-40 minutes. #YesScotland #indyref

I'm flying home to Edinburgh from USA via Brussels. I hope I'm not stateless and stuck in Belgium tomorrow morning #indyref

Turnouts of 80%-90%!? That's insane. Democracy is alive and well it seems, hope we can have the same for the 2015 General Election. #indyref

Electoral fraud WOULD happen in Glasgae. #indyref

Ah the comforts of the fantasy of socialism in one small country  #indyref

Always nice to see regional radio reporters being terrified on national TV #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Going to be following the #indyref coverage on Twitter all day today. A big day in UK history.

Don't believe #Westminster's ( #English ) media ( #TV , #newspapers etc) they made just bias #BbcBias  #indyref #HopeItWillBeYes

Full house at th #indyref all-nighter! Here, some impressions from students #Scotland #studentsvote

I don't mind saying I'm 1 of the 89% who turned out in Clackmannanshire today, well done friends and neighbours! #indyref #VoteNo

#indyref #indyrefallnighter #wordonthestreet Lochdudh turnout 88% all hinges on votes of 2 fat ladies #BreakingNews

We caught Nazi salutes on camera at a demo on Wednesday. #indyref #VoteYesScotland #VoteNoScotland  #ScotlandDecides

I wouldn't use SNP election results to guess different Yes/No: past devo ref votes more useful - eg Moray NOT core Yes territory! #indyref

Look at the table label and then the vote on top of the pile. #indyref #ScotDecides

Some context: at 2010 UK election 5.8m applied for a postal vote, and turnout was 83%, ie 1m applied for a vote but didn't use it! #indyref

Revealed: Yes ballot papers SPOTTED on a No table in Dundee. Here's the response from #indyref

#indyref 'Westminster out of touch with Scotland'. It's out of touch with country! Future indyref in Cheshire or Yorkshire??

So, these guys are all British, right? #IndyRef

So early signs that it's looking like a noisy yes minority losing out to a silent no majority. #indyref

Did anyone in #scotland tally its all about smiles on faces ? #indyref

Hellooooo - how long are you in town for? #indyref

Wonder what Dan Snow thinks about nepotism? #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#Glasgow friends, this is for you!  #indyref  a goodnight from me!

#indyref going to bed. Charity golf day tomorrow and just remembered that I'm the organiser. Oops

and I are so dedicated to the #IndyRef results that we r napping on my sofas until results are due out

Dundee: just 78.8% turnout. Bloody slackers! :) #IndyRef

Thanks Guardian for an amusing  informative, slightly biased view of the Scots' referendum for non-Brits  #indyref

It's so surreal being on the other side of the planet as we nervously await the #indyref result! #proxyvote #ScotlandDecides #ScotinAus

it's a bit slow going at the moment #indyref

Early indication from Glasgow suggests possible narrow No win #indyref

wait a min that should have been 54 percent for #voteyes in Glasgow and 46 no, pos not enough? #indyref #fb

After #Scotland vote no, we should kick them out anyway just for a laugh #indyref

Let us know where you are in the world and what your views are on the #ScottishReferendum. #indyref

#London people - all this #scotland stuff on the telly is annoying isn't it.  Well now you know how we feel ALL THE TIME. #indyref

If Scotland votes Yes,  the debate about Rangers and Celtic playing in England should hopefully be dead and buried #indyref

Lot of Scots diaspora in LA. Mostly Santa Monica/West Side. Prob because #indyref

Mainly based on YouGov sample poll of only 2000 voters  taking no account of unprecedented,over 80% voter turnout #IndyRef

you have just broadcast a clear YES vote on a NO table. What is going on ??? !!!!!!! #indyref

Ballot boxes fae Barra travelling to Lewis by lifeboat. I love it. #indyref

How we spend our evening at the Cruickshank-McLendon household #indyref

This is as boring and drab as watching St Mirren! When do the fireworks and exotic dancing lassies come on?? #indyref

Scotland - the country that always gives 110%.  CNN - Can't Navigate Numbers. #IndyRef

ABC radio news reporting casual exit polls suggest NO vote has probably won in Scotland with about 54 per cent. #indyref

Please go to Sky Channel 512 (#RT News). The hypocrisy is astounding albeit hilarious.#indyref

I don't know what the right answer is, but I know one thing for sure: The Scottish are not the ones making Braveheart jokes. #indyref

so what happens if the vote ends 50/50 ? #justaskin #indyref

From the videos and photos online its looking like a properly good celebration, gutted im stuck in work #indyref

Problem Potentially a big one for the Yes side. Turnout of *just* 78% in Dundee. That's a hotbed of theirs. Needed big numbers. #indyref

Really wish folks would calm down.YES or NO?  We're still playing the long game.And it's already been won.#indyref

there are YES votes in the NO section of counting stations. I have no proof but others are getting retweets for saying this. #indyref

You had one choice to make Scotland, and you fucked it up.#indyref

No expecting strong vote in Edinburgh. Close loss in Glasgow. Low turnout in Dundee. Not looking good for the Nationalists. #indyref

If Huw Edwards takes over when Dimbleby retires, I'm never watching another election coverage. He's awful. #indyref

Lower turn out in Dundee 78.8%. A typically yes friendly area. How much does this lower turn out matter? #indyref

wow, I expected much higher, very disappointing turnout, lowest I've seen tonight #indyref

#indyref ahemremind me , who the heck us dan snow?

#indyref If the whispers are anything to go by, the NO camp are fairing better at this early stage. Yes aren't commenting atm.

#indyref no matter the outcome Scotland should be proud. it has been a peaceful, democratic affair. score one for humanity #ScotlandDecides

Timeline is a dismal storm of stats and anarcho-skepticism #indyref #bedtime

Now were basing vote on who looks happy. #nickrobinson  #johnsmiths daughter and #labourno mp very balanced #bbcbias #BTBULLYBOYS #indyref

Hoping for a no vote in the #indyref but Scotlands choice. Just don't forget your north-east England neighbours if the yes vote wins.

Until some places declare it's the dullest TV ever - and still I can't go to bed. #indyref

WOW, turnout for jocks is amazing (according to ITV) I'm boycotting #BBC for their dreadful tactics #indyref

Bugger it. I've gone for the cornflakes and red wine option. #indyref

Prediction: #indyref finish will be close. Also peaty.

Hope the #ReleaseTheHounds hashtag is something to do with #indyref. Chase the English back over the border maybe?

I'm beginning to feel psychopathic twitches. #IgNobel #indyref

2 final thoughts #IndyRef is a great name for a band  can somebody get ready to mock up a John Terry celebrating photo when the results in!

Dear #indyref, let me know in the morning. But not before you've brought me coffee and shortbread from a tartan tin.Goodnighy

Dundee lets the side down: Scotland #indyref turnout of *only* 78.8%

Police investigating after reports a group of people 'attempted to vote twice' in #indyref in Glasgow

BBC Scottish 'Yes' voter says the 'No' campaign was condescending, patronizing, took their intelligence for granted. #indyref

Watching the (pretty boring) #indyref coverage, dying to see some results. For better or worse hoping for yes from Ireland. #ScotlandDecides

hey, any thoughts on the forged votes in Glasgow? Do you think yours could have been one of them?? Not cool #indyref #VoteYes

BBC1 #indyref all men on the screen.. Can't we vote for a change?

Someone DM me please when we get a result - I'm off to bed  #indyref

My Irn Bru ice lolly has frozen over. What does this symbolise. #indyref commentators please explain

Basically a 50/50 chance now. PM Cameron must have used charisma as a dump stat. #DDO #Indyref #ScotlandDecides

Not sure if Jack McConnell, or if Michael Barrymore is still in hiding. #IndyRef #ScotDecides

62532 votes to be counted, West Dunbartonshire turnout 87% turn out #indyef #ScotlandDecides #indyref

It is mind boggling that ballots need to be hand counted #indyref

Whatever the result of #indyref , the next steps for Scotland and the UK need to be inclusive, collaborative and radically democratic.

Wow, everything trending in the UK on Twitter right now is to do with #indyref.

Hmm, lowish turnout in Dundee. Very interesting #indyref

As an aside, it's quite lovely to have a vote where 79% turnout in an area is being thought of as disappointing. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

some brands are hedging their bets on the outcome of the vote #indyref #indyvote

don't know if the BBC is biased again but it seems to go towards a clear No now #indyref #Scotland

Popping out for five minutes. There'll probably be a declaration while I'm gone. Thank me later. #indyref

Tactical sleep done. Here we go #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Why do people have to go and ruin a good thing? #electoralfraud #indyref

Very interesting that lowest turnout so far is in SNP stronghold of Dundee. What might that mean? #ScotlandDecides #Indyref

#Renfrewshire reports 87% turnout. So far, all turnout above 85% Truly incredible. #indyref

Dan Snow is a bit of yum #indyref we'd be #bettertogether

Westminster MP for Livingston Graeme Morrice believes Yes are 'reasonably well ahead' #indyref

Tweet us your First on the team sheet picture with #indyref tag and while there is no actual news let's put sone Bears on the time line

Rather than tweet about something you know about, just scream conspiracy as loud as possible. Won't look in any way mad #indyref

#indyref the Yes City, Dundee, lowest turnout lol #slap #ScotlandDecides #Scotland  #scottishindependence #no #yes

Saying the no campaign is vague?!How about the yea campaign not being able to state what currency we are going to use?!Ahhhhh rage #indyref

Looking like the highest turnouts may be in the more Conservative/Unionist areas. #indyref

Off to bed - too tired to stay up and find out the result in my homeland - will find out in the morning! #indyref

Sitting up in bed now anxious for the first result #indyref

My latest PB thread #indyref results

Truly impressive turnout for #indyref and such a high level of engagement is making this an intensely dramatic, historical night

If a 3 yes votes can sit at the top or three bundles, imagine how many more are in there? #indyref nevertheless, it appears the Nays have it

That Danny Alexander annoys me. Looks shifty #indyref

I'm glad this robot man voted yes. #indyref #BBC

Loving the coverage of the #indyref Can Rachel and the guys recomend decent coffee for an all nighter aha????

In Quebec 1995, turnout was 93.5pc, Yes came close. For a Yes victory, huge turnout crucial #indyref

The English 'backlash' equalling anything that the #indyref has provoked north of the border.

BBC World filling that lack of results void with lots of chit-chatGawd, up in 5 hours :-/ #indyref

It's ok, the votes were just resting in their account. #indyref meets #fatherted

#indyref pls can people in Scotland stop saying the English are a bunch of right wing oldEtonian Europhobes? we didn't want Cameron either!

Queen is up watching I believe. Bet she has a face like a mile of bad road at the Scottish antics! #indyref

It's at about this time in election proceedings that people generally start mentioning Neil Kinnock #IndyRef

Non fraud,  sky news just explained #indyref

How Has Social Media Affected The Scottish Referendum?  #indyref

Dundee turnout 77% - as a 'Yes' stronghold and a relatively low turnout for this referendum, this is probably bad news for 'Yes'. #indyref

If the reports coming in at this early stage hold up, looks like a win for the NO side. Any Comment?  #indyref #scotlanddecides #ScotDecides

#Cable still the place to watch as well as #FTSE futures both higher on the night. long way to go #indyref

Right. None of you lot voted yes for me to have another. But I had another. Now I'm gonna have another #beerref #indyref

Please check with post for picture clarification. No need for paranoia yet #indyref

Edge pieces of the jigsaw now completed while we watch #indyref

They should have had Simon McCoy doing this for #indyref

FWIW, if I was Scottish, I would've voted Yes. #YesScotland #indyref

#Italians and other southern Europeans very Yes - keen on breaking up the #UK. It's outrageous #indyref

#indyref ..Sooner Gordon Wilson disappears back into the sand the better.

This counting reporter's surname is Polling (h/t #indyref

Our game tonight has been guess the voter on the telly, BBC have had more No's nominated funnily enough ;) #indyref

No voter on bbc listing money, money, money and people being mean about it on Facebook as her reasons :( #indyref

Fair play to the Scottish people though! Massive turnout, people voting with their feet and backing the vote one way or another. #Indyref

Loving hearing a proper Orkney lilt on bbc #indyref coverage still uncertain if the vote will go to the uppies or doonies!

The Sun is reporting there has been tampering in Glasgow.  Hope this isn't true.  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

To stay up or not to stay up to watch the Scottish referendum results. Hmm. #nerd #indyref

I'm still not tired. Running on pure political adrenaline! #indyrefallnighter #indyref

Maybe the way English politics has to change is by introducing proportional representation for local government elections. #indyref

I can't be the only one that doesn't trust these counting staff now after seeing that!? #ScotDecides #indyref

C'mon Clackmannanshire let's start this off with a YES MAJORITY #indyref

#indyref i don't know why but watching BBC coverage of #ScotlandDecides is like Deadline Day on #SSNHQ .. All that's missing is

Guy in BBC audience makes great point. Most of the unanswered questions should have been sorted out over last 2 yrs, not weeks. #indyref

If its a NO I wonder when the big 3 promise will be forgotten about and we don't get extra powers!  #indyref

Er, nope! *Britain* is the name of the island. *UK* is the political entity. No part of the island is about to sink, dude! #indyref

See tweet for those wondering about #Yes ballots on #No table. #ScotlandDecides #indyref #indyrefallnighter

spot the yes vote on the no table #indyref from sky footage

BIG *agree* there ordinary person out-pundits the pundits again #indyref #ScotlandDecides

They've got a hardon over the turnout, but if it's a no vote; we'll go back to not giving a fuck for the next whatever election #indyref

what a 15 hours! Best 15 hours of ma life, bar none! #IndyRef

Struggling a bit with some Scottish names. But keep loving Scotland! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Norman MacLeod saying it's looking like a No vote in Western Isles  blimey, if that's true I'm shocked #indyref

Great atmosphere at #holyrood before the results come in #indyref #scotland #edinburgh

Coffee was invented for science and election nights #indyref

And, just like Major in 1992, will turn out to be the better option. Salmond can't run a country. #indyref

#indyref it's the TOTAL votes that win. Not number of winning councils by one side

Pupils visit the referendum count in Haddington.  #indyref

We'll be live-tweeting the results of the #indyref as they come through in the coming hours - stay posted!#ScotlandDecides

Bit of a lull now as the counting 'proper' continues and as eyes remain firmly fixed on the piles of Yes and No papers #indyref

YES now 20/1. Before a result is announced. #indyref

This could be the highest ever turnout in a political contest in Scotland. Going to be miles above Scot only refs of 79  97. #indyref

Police are now investigating electoral fraud in Glasgow relating to 10 ballot papers #indyref

The latest #YouGov opinion poll gives the 'NO' Vote an 8% lead #indyref #ScottishReferendum

It shows how far we have come when Dundee turnout of 78% is seen as *falling short* All relative tonight. #indyref

How will #Clackmannanshire vote? The beautiful place we got married #indyref

#BBC breaking. Clackmannanshire declaration expected shortly! World suddenly realises it hasn't a clue about Scottish geography #indyref

counting has started in Midlothian now that the Royal Oak has closed its doors..#indyref

As we all await the results of #IndyRef, let us turn to this very scientific poll conducted on Grindr. NSFW language.

Clackmannanshire is worth 0.9% of the entire vote. #indyref

Twitter Sentiment: Scotland = 0.097(Down 0)   England = -0.06(Down -0.01) #indyref #Scotland #UK

STV seeming to move towards Yes campaign autopsy (on currency union, surprise surprise!). #indyref #scotdecides

Being told what happens after Indy before the vote doesn't change anything, it's still independence with the same decisions made #indyref

This had better be good, Matt - looking for ANYTHING after 3 hours waiting for #indyref results here in Scotland

Jim Sillars is just amazingwhy wasn't he in charge of the Yes campaign #indyref

Stap retweeting at shite on my timeline #shite #indyref #scotdecides #Merica #LidlSurprisesNi

Fire alarm sounding at Dundee count!  Everyone out! Count suspended #ScotlDecides #indyref

A actual have butterflies and it's only about to be the 1st out of 32 declarations #indyref

This is fucking ridiculous, it's like Christmas. I'm too excited to sleep. #indyref

1.25am, tiredness not kicking in yet. How you all holding up? #indyref

Clackmannanshire about to announce their results. Getting their moment in the limelight #indyref

True a 79% turnout is amazing but have to say I'm disappointed by the turnout in Dundee. Hope that's not reflective of the Yes vote #indyref

If you're looking for me, I'll be watching BBC #indyref

Starting to flag. Gimme some results #indyref

#Salmond not even attending his own #IndyRef countThat really shows confidence in his side. :p

I'm now envious that I don't live somewhere where a wee plane will ever transport my voting papers. #indyref

Dundee evacuated. Keep cameras running. #indyref

West Dunbartonshire+Inverclyde Yes Clackmannanshire No and Shock No Aberdeen own seat..(Caveat - yet to declare) #IndyRef

Good grief, a fire alarm at Dundee counting so will cause a delay! #indyref

Keep the cameras rolling in Dundee! Da want anyone sneaking in and fucking about with ballots while everyone's mustering  #indyref

Dundee being evacuated because the fire alarms have gone off? Good Lord. #indyref

Dundee turn out 79%: the apathetic bastards. #indyref

#indyref is dundee just adamant to be centre of attention, fire alarms, rumoured rigged voting.

Everyone leaves the precious votes alone and goes outside. Might as well just bend over and let WM fuck us right over.#indyref

'Breaking news' on the BBC Scotland #indyref coverage, meanwhile, is a fire alarm at the count in Dundee.

1:25am and I can't sleep again, maybe keeping up with the #indyref will bore me into a coma. #insomnia

97% of the Scottish electorate registered to vote; whatever the result, that is bloody marvellous! #indyref #ScotlandDecides #Scotland

Gonna stay up all night to watch the #indyref. Hoping for a no vote. #bettertogether

Whatever the result, the high turnout has shown the strength of democracy in the UK #indyref #proudtobebritish

Hmm relatively low turnout in Dundee (79%). Bad news for the Yes campaign. #indyref

Can't wait to hear what happens with #indyref! History in the making.

If I didn't have to work in the morning I'd stay up and follow the #indyref coverage because well, it's all rather exciting, isn't it?

Says something about this vote that Dundee turnout described as *only* 79% #indyref

Addressing the West Lothian Question helps the disintegration of Ed Miliband's degraded Labour Party. #indyref

You're here with me, Jim White, and this is referendum deadline day. #indyref

Fire alarm in dundee. Stuck too many no votes in the incinerator #indyref

A fire?! Yeah okay? Whole thing is rigged for NO! Come on, just happens to be a fire during the count. #indyref

Big night tonight. Thursday night football, Scottish #indyref,#FantasyFootball #nosleep

From the looks of it, The Yes Campaign is been destroyed #indyref #ScotlandDecides

My professor is currently speaking on Charlie Jeffrey is the coolest! #indyref #YesScotland

The 2 main stories tonight are 1. voting fraud in Glasgow and 2. a high turnout. The result of #indyref is definitely taking a backseat

Damn. What a turnout if that's true! #indyref

We have a live table that will update all the results as they come in. Take a look:  #indyref

Fire alarm in the Dundee counting center. #indyref

Someone's phone alarm going off. But Clackmannanshire are NO!! #indyref

First result in #indyref from Clackmannanshire. And the result is: NO

#indyref  fire evacuation at Dundee count. Very, very slow evacuation. Hope it's not a real fire.

Electoral fraud in Glasgow. Fire alarm at Dundee. Something stinks..#indyref

Clackmannanshire results are first in: Yes - 16,350 No - 19,036 #indyref

1st vote of the night: No takes Clackmannanshire! #indyref by c. 3000 votes

Clackmannanshire result YES: 16,350; NO: 19,036 #indyref  (7 voted for both answers, oddly enough)

The UK has more CCTV than anywhere. Transformative! Only privacytards vote YES. #indyref

Keith's #indyref Scotland Wibbly Wobbly  Swingometer Says NO with 54% After 1 out of 32 results

Aw so they are evacuating the counting station in Dundee, sound. That's suspicious as fuck.  #indyref

BOOOOM. Goodnight.  Scotland - #Clackmannanshire votes NO to independence #indyref #skyelections

Fire alarm went off in Dundee count now, wtf is going on? #indyref #ScotDecides

Did someone in Clackmannanshire leave their phone on? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Alex Salmond can't get to his count because of fog apparently so he's heading to Edinburgh instead #indyref

When's Aberdeen  Inverness due out? #indyref

The tag #indyref just makes me think of a boy with a beard running around a football pitch wearing skinny jeans and a Kings of Leon t-shirt

#indyref sure perhaps time for scots to follow Ireland and declare UDI - not so much Scotland the Brave eh

But who goes to vote and puts a X in both boxes? #indyref

That is definitely a no vote now all I can say bollocks #indyref

So, Clackmannanshire will stay in the UK, at least. #IndyRef

Clackmannanshire vote NO by rougly just under 3000 votes, 54%-46%?#indyref

I know it's late, Huw, but 54 minus 46 is definitely not 12. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

so happy right now, well worth staying up for! #indyref

An 8 point lead for No kicks off the #indyref declarations.

#ScotlandDecides that just made me smile Clackmannanshire votes NO in Scotland's #indyref: Yes 16,350 No 19,036 Turnout 88.6%

The first result of the night bringing an early shock! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

1st vote of night in Clackmannanshire. 35,410 votes  88.6% turnout  YES 16,350 NO 19,036  | #IndyRef #TD1Live

#indyref Clacks votes No; less than 3000 margin.  No biggie

Quite interested to see what the voter turnout is for the #indyref

Once Scotland have decided can England have their say in whether or not to be independent from them? #indyref

It's all going a bit Eurovision here folks #indyref

Whose phone alarm just ruined the first declaration? #indyref

Trying to stay awake during these results..#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Don't interrupt the Spoilt Ballots announcement! That's been the best bit so far! 7 people voted both apparently. #indyref #Clackmannanshire

No campaign has significant win in Clackmannanshire. Yes had high hopes there #indyref

Clackmannanshire can't get a yes vote then no many other areas will #Clackmannanshire #indyref

CLACKMANNANSHIRE goes to the No campaign, against independence #indyref #scotdecides

First district is a no, let's keep it up! #indyref

Just as called it for the first result - 46% yes, 54% no. #indyref #clackmannanshire

Watch our documentary charting the rise of Scotland's new media  #indyref #DrumTV

Gotta love the irony of the no camp cheering yes because of a no vote #IndyRef

Clackmannanshire declares - 46.2% yes , 53.8% no #indyref - yes hoped to win this. Seems to match the mood reported from stations so far

Eating a big bowl of porridge in solidarity* w/ Scotland's #indyref*Actually no, it's what I eat every morning.

Confirmed Clackmannanshire No result. They vote Yes 16,350 and No 19,036  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Sterling gets a little nudge higher on first NO result in #indyref. No fireworks yet

i seriously doubt the #IndyRef will succeed. Though I expect a decent showing for yes votes. #didntworkinQuebec

Follow all the Scottish independence referendum results as they come in:  #indyref

We have our first result, it's a No. Hope that isn't setting a precedent #indyref #bbcindyref #ScotlandDecides

Clackmannan effect is 0.08% decline in my overall Yes vote estimate. #indyref

Sad but we have 31 regions to go! #Clackscount  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Dunder counting centre being evacuated due to fire alarm #indyref

One of the bog reasons for the high turnout is just how bloody close the #indyref has been

Harry Hill should have been commentating over that Clackmannanshire footage #camcorder #youvebeenframed #indyref

Hold your tiny horses!  Turn-out Shetland 84%. #indyref

#IndyRef  - first result from Clackmannanshire is NO 54% YES 46%  based on 89% turnout

First result from Clackmannanshire is No!! Yey! Was expected to go nationalist! #indyref

The voter turnout for #indyref is in the mid 80s. I think the closest #america has ever been to that is for the MTV awards #ScotlandDecides

aye cheer ya bastards. won't be so fucking cheerful when Tory's and UKIP screw us over next year. well done. #indyref

first no vote out in Clackmannanshire. 8% win for No. Now to watch the hope drain from the Yes campaign!! #indyref

Can't tell how important this is until all councils declare thier turnout #indyref

No win Clackmannanshire. Big (7%) and surprising win for #bettertogether Early days but bad start for #YesScotland . #indyref

Bit of vigor back into #cable on the Clackmannanshire, No vote #indyref

Everyone being asked to comment on the BBC is white. Everyone. Vast majority men, too. #indyref

Re Clackmann reaction: pundits still thinking along party lines. Mistake! #indyref #voteyes

Just think what the result would have been if the Better Together campaign had been well run. #indyref

I feel that before I clock-off tonight, I have to do one of those lovely, positive statuses I've seen going round, so here goes #indyref

And an other curious thing Clackmannanshire has voted exactly the same % as the yougov poll predicted Scotland has voted as a whole #indyref

Well first blood to no then. In a metaphorical sense. Don't want any real blood spilt. #ScotlandDecides #bbcindyref #indyref #skynews

Dundee folks including counters evacuated in one of top likely YES vote areas. #indyref

What if the English had been this cool about self-rule in 1776? #indyref

54 to 46 is an 8% margin not a 12% margin. COME ON HUW IT'S ONLY HALF 1 #indyref

Relatively low Dundee turnout (79%) bad news for independence campaign #indyref

Wow. First result of #indyref in. #clackmannanshire goes 54%-46% NO in a bit of a surprise. 89% voter turnout. One down 31 to go.

#indyref Genius pollster expert tells us Clack 'gone better for No than Yes'. Cheers for that.

Although disappointingstill early in the night! It's the number of overall votes that countnot the number of regions! #indyref

So who won, the Queen or the People? #indyref

If the Yes folks didn't bother to vote they can't have given very much of a fuck about the whole thing, no? #indyref

Looks like an 8% margin to me Huw not 12% #indyref #clackmannanshire

Aesthetically the UK without Scotland just looks sad, like a headless chicken #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Don't do this to me, Scotland, please. :( #indyref

A significant victory in Clackmannanshire for No and a relatively healthy lead too #indyref

Dundee count delayed due to a fire alarm #indyref

Can you please boot off the team If he doesn't support GB I can't see why he should play for Team GB #indyref

#NO are going to coast home. The NO voters kept quiet. Until they had a pencil in hand. #indyref

First result in from Clackmannanshire, 54% No - 46% Yes. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

If America was deciding whether or not to nuke the world, we'd still only have half the turnout rate Scotland is having for the #indyref

is there a good place to catch #indyref results on the radio?

Clackmannanshire - No 53.8%, yes on 46.2% per Guardian, first results for #indyref that I'm aware of.

First result in - Clackmannanshire - no 53.8%, yes 46.2%  via #indyref

8% lead for the 'no' campaign in the first result of the night. #indyref

Right first result down I'm going to do absolutely anything but this until 5 am #indyref

The dundee count has been halted due to the building being evacuated due to a fire alarm :( #indyref

First results in! 'No' wins in Clackmannanshire. Great start but it's going to be tight. #indyref #bettertogether

First #indyref results from Clackmannanshire 53.7% No, which was supposed to be a Yes stronghold. Expecting Britain as Britain tomorrow.

looking like Scots may have voted not with their heart but with their sporran #indyref

MT Odds NO vote wins #indyref up to 96%. It will be conventional wisdom in an hour.

#indyref Scotland decides whether to break away, or not :

1 down 31 to go. We're in for a long night. #indyref

has a live results page up and running #indyref

Traitorous NO celebrating the death of a country. Scotland is finished. Especially the poor and sick. Never forgive them ! #indyref

From what I'm hearing, it sounds increasingly like there's been some sort of vote thing going on. #indyref

This is gonna go on forever. I can't work out why I care. We've already taken Scotland's best asset (Stefan Scougall) #indyref

I've been in meetings all day (as has How's #indyref working out? (I figure asking you is quicker than checking BBC.)

Huw Edwards can't work out 54-46. Bloody BBC Dumbing down #indyref

Nick Robinson clearly gutted by that result. #bbcpolitics #indyref

#indyref It was shown live. Are you watching BBC England version?  for BBC1 Scotland (RHS)

I can see Cameron addressing Scotland in the morning and saying about devo-max, we were only kidding #indyref

Looks like No is going to win. Good. Unity is better for everyone. The system needs change definitely but better doing it together. #IndyRef

Advantages of the 9-hour time difference between Australia and UK - get to watch the #indyref results come in live without losing sleep

dundee counting place being evacuated? #indyref #FIX

lol! Course there would be! Passions running high #indyref

That Dundee low turnout? Looks like 71% Yes. #indyref

The win there for both sides is that Britain now knows that there's a place called Clackmannanshire. #indyref

have decided to stay up all night to bring you the news live on the #indyref #UnitedWeStand #BetterTogether #WeLoveScotlandToo

As Clackmannanhire goes so goes the nation Results ofrom Clackmannanshire:YES 16KNO 19K #indyref

Or drunk. That's always a good possibility #indyref

First result spot on with yougov poll. Thank goodness those nice men Clegg Cameron  Miliband saved the Scots from themselves #indyref

are #indyref districts same electoral districts in general elections?  Thanks much, from a proud Canadian who voted NO in 1995.

Mary Pitcaithly announcing No win in Clackmannanshire. Hardly any reaction from campaigners. No applause. #indyref

Yes votes on no tables and results on screen before there announced. It's a fix a tell ye #indyref

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER TO POST THIS #IndyRef

I feel kind of cheated. We had to shoot people for our independence. Regardless, good luck Scotland! #indyref

Drink if you wikipiedia searched Clackmannanshire.  #drinkalong #indyref

No shame in backing a losing cause if it was the right thing to do.Even when winners are grinners and they write the history. #indyref

Aw. No you'll come round once you see the neon lights bounce off Nick's big baldy bastard head. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Why people don't see we are already living in the no vote I don't know? It is not going to get better, only worse #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Ha ha . very good! #indyref was the mandate SNP got from the people and the turnout is fantastic.The people are responding! :-)

I can tolerate any outcome to #indyref apart from people getting all arsey, claiming it's fraud  hating those who voted no #ScotlandDecides

Looking at the numbers. I admit, being Italian I actually wish I was Scottish. People who REALLY care about their Country. #indyref

86% turnout in West Lothian. Where they keep the Question #indyref

The #indyref has been exciting politics  How is it the BBC are serving up this yawn fest? Incredible

Results from the Shire are starting to roll in, and the hobbits are anxious. #indyref

surely we will take this. We fought the better campaign! Thank your for all your efforts! #indyref

Sometimes, watching CSPAN gets me all nostalgic. Tonight, it's BBC News. #indyref #bettertogether

Next seven minutes for the next declaration in Orkney according to BBC. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Of course with all the excitement of the #indyref I momentarily forgot the Singapore Grand Prix hits town this weekend too.

And the world wakes up and discovers that Clackmannanshire is an actual place. #indyref

So the first count is for #unity, Here's hoping this is indicative of the entire result #indyref

Sounds like Salmond made the right call staying home tonight. #indyref

Watching the results roll in for the Scottish referendum. If only participation rates were this high for general elections #indyref

I thought my alarm was going off then #indyref

Coatbridge parliamentarians Tom Clarke and Elaine Smith at NL #indyref count

Agree with #Clackmannanshire a superb name. Love the Scottish areas! Bizarre watching from afar #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Roar of applause in Edinburgh's student union as no wins Clackmannanshire, pretty clear what Scotland's students want #indyref

By the way, jolly well done on the turnout, fellow Scots! It's brilliant that so many people wanted to have a voice :) #indyref

Actually it is fearmongering. I also heard that some #VoteNo campaigners say they should have put in more effort. #indyref

1st result out and #nothanks  prevailed. Well, its the smallest council anyway. I guess its a NO sleep for me tonight. #indyRef.

Orkney next, should have some solid Unionist backing here #indyref #indyrefallnighter

The count is well supervised and reliable, don't get confused w other countries #indyref

Clackmannanshire letting the whole team down straight away, poor start #indyref

UK GENERAL ELECTION 2015: #indyref RESULTS 32 Scottish counting regions  #scotlandDecides voting as it comes in

A 90% turnout means that Yes could impose it's will on Scotland w a little over 45% of the population. Who agreed to this?? #indyref

Whatever the result of #indyref, Scots had their voices heard -- looks like nearly 90 percent turnout.

I'm mesmerized by elections, watching live vote counting in Scotland #indyref

I think I have a few ideas of what may have gone wrong, if we lose Scotland's #indyref. The power of the media campaign WAS underestimated.

You have no idea what this has done 2 Lab support in Scot. Lab 2 get slaughtered next vote 4 H'rood #indyref

Very disappointing that the politics of fear and negativity seem to have worked. Goodnight all, Farewell liberty for Scotland.  #indyref

22:22 - Clackmannanshire count starts; 01:31 - result. 35,410 votes, 3h 9 min to count. 187 votes counted per minute. #geektweet #indyref

West Lotian looks likely to go to the Noes. #indyref

*whiles away time until next declaration by doing council by council analysis of ex-boyfriend distribution* #indyref

So by all accounts, it's going to be a 'No' vote. Is anyone really surprised? What a monumental waste of time and money! #indyref

There's a smoker at the Dundee count hiding in the loo right now and sweating. Guarantee. #indyref

Gotta go to bed unfortunately. Seems like democracy is the real winner. Which is bloody amazing #indyref

Exactly.  That is only about 1% of those who have voted. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Although, having said that, if they'd gone, I wouldn't have shed a tear. Their funeral. #indyref

Still too early to call. I expect Glasgow will have a very big impact #indyref

Clackmannanshire has said No at #indyref should the other side be worried yet to 1% population, not yet! Not yet

David Coburn Of UKIP on BBC dressed like a clown. How appropriate. #indyref #bbcnews

BBC Scotland is now canning its plans for a sitcom on Clackmannanshire independence fighters, which was to be called 'Alloa Alloa'. #indyref

Big news day: #indyref #Alibaba   #Albania government sacks central banker

Like Brigadoon, Clackmannanshire can only trend on Twitter once every 100 years. Glad to witness history #indyref

First no of the night hopefully not many more.#indyref

UKIP fella get off my tv! Glad UKIP kept fairly quiet through the #indyref

Wonder what might've been if everyone in Westminster had continued ignoring #indyref to the end instead of being spooked by that STimes poll

Have not told anyone how I've voted,  I don't want to, and I won't say whatever the result when it comes out #indyref

Where is David Dimbleby?   Has he done a Bruce Forsyth?  #indyref #indyrefallnighter #bbcindyref

You mean UKIP were keeping their mouths shut so note to energise the yes vote #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Scotland #IndyRef - with 1/32 councils (0.9% of eligible voters) it's:Yes 46.2%No 53.8%Turnout: 88.6%

I'll be on early tomorrow talking #indyref. Spread the word if you know anyone from Philly

So 97% of Scotland turned out to vote in the #indyref? Are you scared now Westminster? We have a voice! You will hear us! #yes

Clackmannanshire votes NO - it was given a 'yes' rating of 10 by Credit Suisse where 10 is most likely to vote yes.Still early days #indyref

Turnout is suggested to be highest since universal suffrage; that level of engagement can only be a good  productive thing #indyref

Thanks for the sweet tweets, but #indyref has nothing to do with me. I do hope the people of Indianapolis can refinance their homes though.

Watching results. As political nerds do. #indyref #bettertogether

Well, hasn't quite called it yet. But if pressed, I reckon he might suddenly say he thinks David Miliband has won. #indyref

Here is a list of the regions voting in Scotland and expected timings for announcing results#indyref

This reminds me of 1997's Election Night Armistice and Steve Coogan's psephologist calling it after one result. #indyref

Was anyone actually surprised that Andy Murray was a nationalist? #indyref

I predicted that if turnout was 80-85% Yes would win. 85% No. Seems to be playing out. #indyref

Yes win or No win, has lost. Effectively sidelined in the campaign, confirming Yes voters fears about #indyref

Excited by election all nighter newbies! Feels like a nerdy club at school has just got cool #indyref

finally some sense arrives. He's been a great politician and ambassador. Come on #YES get the numbers crunched! #indyref

Why can't the people of Scotland realise that if we vote no then they are not going to have a say in who runs the country #indyref

No matter the results, I think it's amazing that Scotland had such high voter turn-out. #IndyRef

Sandwiches now being restocked at Perth count centre. #indyref

exactly. It's worth watching man in the back row versus Nigel Farage on QT. Same answers as Salmond. #indyref

7 people in Clackmannanshire voted both Yes and No. Well done. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Started falling asleep but I think that Clackmannanshire won and now the whole of UK is part of Clackmannanshire. Congratulations. #indyref

Where can I actually follow the #indyref results come in? It's all a bit of a mess.

Is anything interesting happening outside Parliament? #indyref

We don't even know what result will be  #yessers pulling all sorts of excuses out of the bag for a defeat. #waitandsee #indyref

If there's a silver lining in this unfolding catastrophe, it's that the contempt Labour holds Scotland in has been unveiled. #indyref

I'm knackered. I've been counting postal votes for ages and am home now but want to stay up to watch the results #dilemma #indyref

I believe Scotland should be an independent sovereign state. I also believe in democracy and will respect the will of the majority #indyref

A little early but it looks like common sense has prevailed in Scotland. #indyref goodtosee

Andrew Marr's theory of class is fucking ludicrous. #indyref

#indyref are your feet also seeking to separate from rest of your body after day of gotv and polling place duty

Neither does London and you don't see us complaining (We're apparently too smug and up our own arses anyways). #indyref.

calling it a day, think its safe to go to bed now. no need to worry #indyref

Weeks ago I predicted that Salmond's position on the pound would lose it, sadly I have a feeling that will be the case. #indyref

Didn't think I would care this much. Watching from the other side of the world with butterflies in my stomach! #indyref

Ah, Stirling, the constituency that bucked the national trend in 1992 when Michael Forysth successfully defended a majority of 300. #indyref

no. #indyref shows Lab it doesn't need to be a nicer Tory party to win. Please give us an alternative. Please.

Turnouts reported from 9 councils so far puts average at 86.2% #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Looks like the big turnout is due to quiet No voters #bbcindyref #indyref

The turnout in Shetland - 15,635 votes cast, 84.4% of the electorate. #indyref

Been said by so many people so often as to be meaningless, but it really is inspiring to see so many people have gone out and voted #indyref

Need  #IndyRef results and need them now. #Scotland

First results in the Scottish Independence Referendum are in: Clackmannanshire - 46.2 (Yes); 53.8 (No)  #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Clackmannanshire fairly SNP and home to significant D/E social demographic, interesting 1st result - Expecting stronger yes vote#indyref

East Renfrewshire turn out 90.5% for referendum #representing #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Senior UK trade union leader tells that he would have voted Yes. #indyref

I'm not surprised at the high turnout. I'm gobsmacked that more than 10% of Scots didn't manage to vote #indyref

These turnout numbers are INSANE.85+% turnout consistent in many areas, even 100% turnout in one town. #indyref

Amazing how that one poll last Sunday might have been the worst thing that could have happened to Yes #Indyref

Can we get these D-list politicians off my tv screen and instead get Orkney's vote #indyref

West Lothian Yes Camp unofficially indicate they have lost in that area. #indyref #Scotlanddecides

Now is a good time to bury bad tweets #indyref

SNP scrutineers saying 45% yes in West Lothian, down 2% on SNP result, matching Clackmannanshire #indyref

#indyref We've only had one result,  labour are claiming victory,  and Johann Lamont and some SNP bloke are fighting already.

Oatcakes, Oban scotch, BBC + live blogs from Guardian and Irish Times, and : ideal #indyref waiting conditions.

I love Margaret Curran's fierce bob #TheImportantIssues #indyrefallnighter #indyref

Gutted history will not be made with #indyref locals have bottled it! #IrnBru

Exciting to read things like this: Craigmillar had more voters through its doors by 9.30am than it did for the entire 2010 Election #indyref

Whatever the result, the #indyref is great for my Geography and Vocabulary #clackmannanshire

Again, only 2 polls in September had Yes ahead in the #indyref in Scotland

But how did and vote in #indyref? Pretty sure Hector would've voted No. #MonarchOfTheGlen forever.

Scottish Tory leader beams as the Clackmannanshire No win is announced  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I can't. I've been doing that for the last 20 hours. I just can't do it! I can't compare it #indyref

Aberdeen turnout comes in at 81.7%, Aberdeen City Council says #indyref

In the scale of things, Clackbollockshire is a splash in an ocean. The big cities might wipe it clean. Time shall tell! #indyref

Aaaaaand Twitter has calmed down a little bit again #indyref #indyrefallnighter #independencescotland

BBC 2 coverage a lot better than BBC 1 .. #indyref

How are all my Scots going? #indyref #No

No campaign sources now believe #indyref will finish around 55/56% to no; Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire no; Inverclyde  Dundee yes

Scotland said NO!Great Britain LIVES! #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence #ScottishReferendum #ScotsDecide #indyref #independencescotland

One local authority's declaration of No does not mean it won't happen yet! :)#indyref

Can't understand the people that voted no.  I don't think you can call yourself Scottish to be fair.. #indyref #VoteYes #ScotlandDecides

South Ayrshire turnout is 86.1%, East Ayrshire is 84.5% #indyref

Stirling and East Renfrewshire turnout both over 90% #indyref #ScotDecides #wow

Fun fact: Orkney is capable of physically detaching itself from the UK, drifting freely across the sea if it unfurls its sails. #indyref

Will someone shut that ukip prick up #indyref

Can someone turn the UKIP MEP's microphone down? That last intervention was moderately frightening #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Fuck! Another Labour Lord salivating his gravy dribble all over the BBC! Whatever happens, Labour's finished in Scotland! #indyref #voteyes

Glasgow turnout 75% #indyref Huge for thembut is this bad news for Yes? #indyref

Equally, the markets WOULD panic if the vote is Yes, its how they work. But they'd get over it. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Its not gonna be fixed for fuck sake be realistic #indyref

LATEST #indyref: First result from Clackmannanshire: No 53.8%, yes  46.2%, #ScotlandDecides

Yes taking a beating. Oh, Yes. #indyref

Why can't Johann Lamont look at Pat Kane in the face #indyref

90% turnout in Stirling and East Renfrewshire. Good show. So proud of these numbers. Scotland truly has decided. #indyref

The fraudulent votes will still count!?!? #indyref WTF?

Um, turnout for #indyref was 90%, America. You know we have elections coming up, right?

Who fucking thought giving a UKIP prick airtime on BBC Scotland was a good idea? #indyref

Independence oooooo Scotlands been a baaaaaaaad boy #indyref

There's a UKIP MEP on the  results programme. What?#indyref

Snp are stating they believe this might be a bad night.. #good #indyref

For god sake don't listen to anything anyone says until it's officially announced. People talk bullshit too remember. #indyref

I was not born in Scotland  but I love it as if it were a Scott. #IndyRef

Stewart Stevenson, SNP MSP, says 'Well, I hope it's a world record turnout.' #indyref

I really need to sleep but I want to watch! I've set an alarm for 6:45 and if the results in before that and I miss it I'll be mad! #indyref

Loch Ness monster says it will move to Lake Tahoe if #Scotland votes 'yes' - Scottish tourism Minister is in a frenzy. #Indyref

10 ballot papers siezed as evidence by police investigating Electoral Fraud in #Glasgow #IndyRef

Blame the failure of the yes campaign on the English lack of contingency. Get off my tv you plank #indyref

Its good to be on the other side of the world during the referendum. No staying up for me! #indyref

UKIP MEP reminds me of Rush Limbaugh (at least in his delivery) #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Fantastic voter turnout so far as the numbers start leaking out. Regardless of the result, well done, Scotland! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Forget the revolution. teens on George Square are now just snogging each other #indyref

Glasgow is the real key in this I reckon! #Indyref #VoteYes #ScotlandDecides

So 75% of people turn out to vote in #Glasgow for the #indyref

East Ren winning the turnout totaliser. #indyref

So tired! Need to stay awake to see the decision #indyref

genuinely surprised it's so low. #indyref

It's an interesting day when you're looking at a 75% voter turnout and labeling it 'disappointing' #indyref

Don't bother with Home Rule, Cameron. You're going to walk this; they're quite obviously smitten with you. #Indyref

Clackmannanshire the only #indyref area to declare so far, 54% for No. For further updates check out:

1 in 4 in Glasgow couldn't be bothered voting FFS #indyref #indyrefallnighter

We had to dump tea in a river and they get ballots?? Where is the justice. #indyref

If Glasgow with a 75% turnout go Yes, their mandate in Glasgow won't be as big as No's mandate elsewhere. #indyref

If the rumoured results are true it's looking like an east-west split. Ironic given the north-south split was an argument for Yes. #indyref

Guys if everyone keeps typing Clackmannanshire, twitter will run out of letters. #indyref

Right, I'm up. Let's do this. In the words of Shakespeare's Sister: Stay (Scotland). #indyref

May be only 75% turnout in but it is the biggest authority in Scotland so still an enormous amount of people. #indyref

That glasgow turnout is disastrous. Oh dear oh dear. #indyref

108,626 votes now being counted in Falkirk #jpScotRef  #indyref

If the #IndyRef vote is 'Yes' in the morning. Just remember that Trident will belong south of the border!!

75% is a VERY poor turnout considering the other areas #indyref

Definitely illustrates the speed of news and the need for fresh news stories constantlyMonday's #indyref news will be non-news tomorrow

Reporting for #JMA here in Scotland: Sterling 90% 62,225 votes cast turnout Dundee 79 % turnout 93.558 votes cast #indyref

Watching and following #indyref results on ( Might need some tea before the night's out.

#indyref #scotlanddecides Glasgow is a massive disappointment. 75% on a day of 85-91% elswhere. That could be the deal breaker.

Stirling turnout 90%Dundee turnout 79%Glasgow turnout 75%#indyref #scotlanddecides live updates

#indyref is there a river of tears on byres road yet?

Aye ten mins is all westminster needs to switch a few thousand ballots to no! Probably had cameron doing it himself. Sly bastard! #indyref

Johanna Lamont there, time-sharing Alistair Darling's eyebrows. #IndyRef

Why does it take so much time to count the votes? Not very efficient poll system. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

#indyref glad not working tomorrow no sign of sleep for me tonight

#indyref 75% turnout?people just slept and forgot to vote?This is the most important election forat least a generationand people stayedhome?

I have an #indyref question: are total no votes versus total yes votes what decides it or is it total yes counties versus total no counties?

I think some of Scotland have shat it. #indyref

what's the voting system used in Scotland during the #Indyref then?

I'm so excited!! I honestly can't breathe! My heart is racing! This is tense! Shaking so much! #indyref #ScottishReferendum

Very disappointed to see that 1/5 of Aberdeen  1/4 of Glasgow didn't vote. Can't fathom why.#indyref #ScotlandDecides

My Kyrgyz coworker made a good point re #indyref : what if Crimea were allowed to vote this way w/o Russian interference?

Retweet if you're trying to sleep over the Scottish referendum. I am. #indyref

Nice being in the US for this, don't have too stay up too late for the results #indyref

I really thought Romney had a shot in Clackmannshire#indyref

Well done to the team at bbc Scotland for taken us from 11pm until 9am! Bring on the next vote count! #indyref

Let #English profanity end as the sun prepares to set on the death of an unnatural empire that had polluted the world for long. #indyref

Oh fuck you too Glasgow. A QUARTER of you couldn't be fucked voting? #indyref

These turnout percentages are amazing. Westminster take note #indyref

A PR-elected English parliament is the blatantly obvious answer to the English question. #indyref

If yo voted NO and that is the result then this is what Scotland will face ,thanks #indyref

#indyref need to get to bed but..love watching democracy in action. Go Scotland.

lowest so far 75%  highest 91% so far. Could it be to do with poverty levels? #indyref

I'm amazed that there are voter turnouts of over 80% in Scotland for the #indyref but yet it's to be expected

Meanwhile, East Dunbartonshire with the highest turnout yet! 91% Good job, friends. Proud of us Shirefolk of the Briggs and around. #indyref

I may have to go to sleep #stress #indyref

Massive well done to fantastic throughout #indyref #bettertogether

All you NO voters - remember - 5 more years of cuts. #justdeserts #indyref

53.8% Clackmannanshire - NO! Feeling confident now. Need sleep for work but can't get to sleep :( #indyref #maintainourunion

Blimey, this talk of an English Parliament really is ridiculous. A truly terrible idea #indyref

Some yes ballots were put in the the No votes. there are even pictures to prove this. And your being a sore loser. #indyref

Amazed by #indyref turnout numbers. Shows that if given a real choice between clear alternatives, voters do care.

Turnouts too low in the strongly Yes cities, looks like the game is up #indyref

Voting no to your own country's independence, damn embarrassing on a world stage #indyref

If #indyref passes, I'm shaving my head.  If it fails I'm shaving my beard.  Either way, I'm shaving mah pubes.

Can you confirm the votes are safe after the fire alarm? Any evidence of foul play? #indyref

The election isn't a fix! The votes are being counted fairly, please don't make a big deal out of nothing. It's only just started! #indyref

Aww come on Glasgow only a 75% turn out! #indyref

Scottish referendum: Police investigate electoral fraud probe in Glasgow  #indyref

Keep me updated on the #IndyRef status Scots. Definitely intrigued to see how it plays out.

Out of the only village in Scotland with the votes counted, the outcome is a NO so far I am hoping for the best here #indyref #nothanks

The palpable sense of summut but not knowing what. like going to bed on Xmas eve and waking up Monday morn. Awake but no fuck given #indyref

I'd really go on watching the #indyref report but I have to wake up early and so I leave hoping I'll start the day with #TeamGB still united

A week ago I thought the fall out of the #indyref was going to be a nightmare for Cameron. It's looking worse for Miliband at the minute

wants to be quick dont want to spend all my birthday in bed lol might stay up till 4am#indyref

I'm feeling the need to wear a GB flag like a cape for the next week in celebration! #indyref

Looking like some early results and an amazing turnout.feeling proud whatever the result #indyref

Compared to other electoral areas in 80s  90s, Glasgow #indyref turnout only 75%! 25% couldn't be arsed to vote. Despairing!!

#indyref debate got a little heated at times, but still#scotlanddecides  these Americans what are they on?

Only 75% turnout in could work in favour of #indyref

Clicked on the live stream on the #BBC. Wall to wall Fucking Tories. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

This woman on needs to calm down. It's ten votes! #indyref

cant sleep thinking about the scotland referendum, whatever happens i just hope that there isn't an outbreak of violence and riots #indyref

These voter turnout numbers are incredible. U.S. should take heed. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I hope Scotland becomes independent. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

2nd result of the night is out - Orkney votes No!! That's 2nd win to the #nothanks #indyref #bettertogether

#ScotlandDecides #indyref High turnout because every vote counts. Shows major problems of First Past The Post

Yes: 4,883 No: 10,004 Rej: 20. Low rejections again #indyref

If Cameron would like to 'diffuse tensions' he should do the decent thing  resign. It's the only way to be sure. (Of anything) #indyref

Another No vote. God Bless you Orkney #indyref

Boom! Orkney rejects the stupid idea of Scottish independence. Good. #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref Orkney turnout at 83.7% votes NONo 67.20%Yes 32.80%

who cares about the turnout we just wanna know who won the vote  #indyref

Orkney goes NO by around 5000 votes (surprise surprise) #indyref

#Orkney, not a surprise, No wins with  67.2% 2nd of 32 local councils to declare results in Scotland #indyref

I really hope Scotland says #no tonight. The alternative just isn't worth the risk. #indyref

25% of Glasgow don't even care if Scotland is part of the UK or not. #indyref

Orkney the NOs have it the NOs have it#indyref

#indyref Am I about 2 be a citizen of North Britain rather than an independent Scotland? What a thought:(

Orkney. FANTASTIC! Total drubbing of the SNP. #indyref

Thank you so much, Orkney for voting for a strong Scotland within a United Kingdom! #indyref #BetterTogether

After Orkney's result, this is not looking well. #indyref

#indyref BBC prog going well educating the watching youth about problems facing Scotland then bring on a muppet actor spouting nonsense #bed

Islanders know what side their bread is buttered on #indyref

Why do you vote in favour of both? Just don't vote. Seems like a waste of time #indyref #ScotlandDecides

The elderly of Orkney must really hate their children. #indyref

I love the Orkney accent though, I could listen to it all day #indyref

First regional results of Scottish independence vote roll in:  #indyref

Another 'No', this time from Orkney. 2-0 to Better Together. #indyref

Yes 4,883 No 10,004 Orkney. #indyref (Should have been closer)

So, after all the events, hype and headlines of the last few months one-in-four voters in #Glasgow didn't vote?! #indyref

David Coburn could be one of the Harkonnens from Dune. #indyref

Who are these mugs marking both boxes? #indyref #mouthbreathers

Proof if 'twere needed that Orkney hates Scotland. #indyref

I done my part for my homeland #indyref #ScotlandDecides #voteyes

One of the key qs of #indyref nite. Where is John Curtice? Maybe the Beeb couldnt afford his all-nighter fee.

I can't sleep and there is a weird air about the place. Edinburgh apparently feels like a festival atm. Can't wait for the #indyref result.

Orkney I just deleted you from facebook. #indyref

The chap at the Yes Scotland event for BBC One Scotland has a wild shirt on. His dancing shirt obviously #indyref

Quite proud that 91% of East Dumbartonshire (where I grew up) voted. Disappointed by only 75% turnout in Glasgow. #indyref

Something to vote for, then the people will respond. I only hope that the people in NI, cared so much. #indyref #Aye 2/2

And it's a No from the Orkney Islands with 67.20% #indyref 30 to go..

#Scotland's #indyref shows 'No' side taking early lead in first region to report result.

#indyref, more sense on Orkney than I thought, well done the Orkadians.#Bettertogether

I'm hanging on to hope. These where 2 small counties that were expected to vote no. #indyref

#indyref Is it Eck or Beck sings Loser? All together now

Second result in and No expands its lead to 58%. Still a LONG way to go though (30 more) #indyref

Thunder and lightening as well as torrential rain in #london for the first time in ages.  Shedding tears over #indyref results?

Where can I find the most up to date poll numbers on the vote? #indyref

Ooops - just 33% vote YES in the Orkneys; 67% vote NO It really is all over now #indyref

Our live results by region page will keep you up to date throughout the night  #indyref

Watching from Texas. Boo Orkney. *smh* #indyref #VoteYes

While it looks good, the real hint will be as the bigger towns come in. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Second official result: Orkney, with 84% turnout, went 4,883 Yes (33%) and 10,004 No (67%). #indyref

2 people tried to vote for both yes and no in Orkney, what? #indyref

The results are coming in for Scottish independence referendum  #indyref

Hearing Nigel Farage will speak on English devo tomorrow BEFORE Cameron is expected to do the same. Attempting to preempt perhaps? #indyref

Love the Orkney result. That said it's easier to be a Lib Dem stronghold without or university or students I suppose. #clegg #indyref

Cameron's response to the #indyref, apparently: greater English insularity. Honestly, Labour, get your arse into gear. Offer an alternative.

Hefty win for #BetterTogether in Orkney #indyref - 58% yes - 42% No - However to be expected!

Finally, some numbers in #indyref. Waiting for the cities. Looking good from my perspective.

No : 67% Yes: 33% Votes : Around 55 000 of 4,2 millions #indyref #ScotlandDecides #VoteYes #VoteNo

2/32 Orkney Votes No. 67%  to 33%. 83.7% Turnout. Total Votes: 10,004 to 4,883. #bettertogether #indyref #ScotlandDecides

It's going to be a late night for me. Hooked #indyref

Orkney votes NO by 67% to 33% - but less reported is the fact that 2 voters in Orkney voted both YES  NO! #indyref

UK dramatically changed tonight. Perhaps this was what #YES were aiming for while hoping for more. Could be a bumpy ride. #indyref

One solitary cheer as Orkney goes No by 10004 to 4883 votes. #indyref

Vote tally so far - 21,233 for Yes and 29,040 for No - still very early. #indyref

Orkney are two to one No. Still these people eat Puffins.  #indyref

Doing my best to not stay up watching #indyref Come on #Scotland. Just count the paper already!

Tried to sleep. Managed about an hour. Back up. Damn you Scotland. #indyref

Ooft. Already ugly trolls declaring hate for Scotland. So sad. Stay dignified #indyref is a momentous win for democracy whether yes or no

Good to see liberal Orkney voting clearly for no. I think #LibDem strongholds will be strong rejectors of independence. #indyref

Find it rather amusing that I'm at desk writing about Miley's latest escapades for Cosmo Australia and watching #indyref unfold at same time

It says something about Scotland that Cameron Stout is still a 'former Big Brother winner' and not a 'local political leader' #indyref

Trying not to feel deflated as its early doors but am sat with a face like a smacked arse, disappointed orks #scottishindependence #indyref

#indyref sounds like a referee that listens to the strokes and shops at urban outfitters?

I'm on the edge of my seat (and will likely be all night) This decision is huge and I am certainly praying for Scotland's decision. #indyref

I can NO longer take this my eyes are hurting so am off to bed and YES I will have a good nights sleep #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Big NO from Orkney! Love you #indyref

Unconfirmed reports of a 61% NO vote in Edinburgh #indyref will have to wait for official figures

Scotland has let Westminster know that they can do whatever they like. It's only going to get worse from here #indyref

The spoilt ballot papers in Orkney were probably caused by being burnt in a big wicker man #indyref

Is it just me are all no voters racist, bigoted selfish cunts? #indyref

In fact, the fact that Better Together is pouncing on these first two tiny councils as a victory shows how worried they are! #indyref

Concerned about having to show my passport on the train up to Edinburgh tho (this is entirely a possibility I'm not being a twat) #indyref

On the flip side, shouldn't England have been given the opportunity to vote as to whether to allow Scotland to remain in GB? #indyref

We've had 52,538 postal votes returned in Fife. That's 94.15% of the postal votes we issued #indyref

MyPOV: Turn out for #ScotlandDecides in the high 80% low 90% range nationwide is a great advert for democracy #indyref

Dad insists G-Gran (nee Mackenzie of Inverness) Murphy would have voted No. I have no idea. We're Canadian, Dad. We're spectators. #indyref

Wish I didn't have to go to work in half an hour. I'm quite amused keeping up with the #indyref

I think it's strange that people are using a democractic process to vote against becoming more democractic. #indyref

Thunderstorm in London an omen of things to come in Scotland?#indyref #Scotland #ScotlandDecides #storm

sad that it took #indyref to get people out to vote.. you cannot blame the govt if you don't vote

2:30am: Woken by huge crashes of thunder and torrential rain. Checked #indyref score, now back to bed

The turnout rates for the #indyref are incredible. If only we could have that level of turnout for general, European and local elections.

Councillors saying Glasgow may be a No, just. Salmond has said he will not be showing face at count in his own city of Aberdeen. #indyref

On my 1st trip to Scotland in '98, I wanted to stay forever. Praying whatever the outcome is, there's peace. #indyref #bettertogether

Correction: over 7 times as many votes in Glasgow than the total that have already been counted. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Orkney lack faith. I smelled that No two years ago. #indyref

As an Englishman, I am also proudly British. Looks like the majority of Scots are too. #indyref

Na h-Eileanan an Iar ?!? Is that where the Nazgul live ?  Any where near Rivendell ? #indyref

Will notice Scotland exists if we go independent? #indyref #scottishindependence #YesScotland

Ermmm how would you get on if you had to campaign with a NO tag hanging around your neck? #indyref

There are rumors that Alex Salmond's own constituency voted No on the #indyref. Did he badly misjudge his own people?

I was entirely planning on doing a serious live tweet session of the #indyref but I have just nosedived back to my usual childish self

Currently, 42% of voters want independence in the smallest and most rural areas of Scotland. #YesScotland #indyref #positive

Expecting a result from Eilean Siar in 15 minutes #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Fair point. But federalism issue arises because of promises made by #bettertogether campaign #indyref

Cometh the hour,cometh Brown. He may have bankrupt the country, but deserves every credit for making sure that UK did not go broke #indyref

Here's the Scottish referendum results page from BBC. Seems to be the most user friendly I've seen so far. #indyref

Everyone from the NO camp on BBC is coming across as arrogantly and condescendingly as the NO campaign did #indyref

Sitting here crying, ma people got offered freedom on sept the 18th but decided against it. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Eilean Siar result in ten to fifteen minutes #indyref

75% turnout for Glasgow is considered low? We do well in to get 60% turnout in America. #indyref

75% turnout Glasgow better than the general election but still :( #indyref #VoteYesScotland

Johann Lamont sounds like she's trying to do an impression of Don Corleone in The Godfather! #indyref #scottishindependence #referendum

Rumours Edinburgh could go 60-40 No Glasgow looks like the ballgame #indyref

Eilean Siar results expected in next 10ish minutes, according to BBC  #indyref

Whoever wins, the real winner will be democracy in Scotland. The people will decide. We're lucky to have that right - many don't. #indyref

Why on earth is the turnout for Glasgow so low. Too many parties  not enough getting votes out? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

A bigger idiot than Michael Forsyth I have never seen before #indyref

Turnout set to be 84% for #indyref, topping previous Scottish election high of 81% in 1951, says Prof John Curtice

Intrigued to see the Scotland #indyref vote totals come in. #yesorno

Come on!! Why are you so pessimistic? Just for 50.000 votes?? #yesscotland we are going to win! #indyref

Broken out the Jura, these massing grinning hyenas are breaking my balls. Can we yet break out the Lions to frighten them off? #indyref

I just called it here at the Montrose. #indyref

#jeremyvine's #indyref graphics are making my head spin

It's a beautiful thing, democracy. To vote instead of fight is a novel idea. Thinking of #Scotland tonight! #indyref

Feeling confident that the campaign will win this thing! #RuleBritannia! #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Noise on the wire from East Lothian, Fife and Edinburgh - NOT FINISHED COUNTING - but all tweeting about comfortable No leads #indyref

#BBC1Scotland Thanks for letting those of us outside the UK watch your coverage view streaming #Indyref #ScotlandDecides

As the votes get counted looks like #yes   Is floundering and the silent majority has spoken loud and clear #indyref #ScotDecides

#indyref Thunder and lightening above London skies - This is more of a sign than first two results #VoteYes

Thunder and lightning over London as Scotland determines its future. #indyref

I hope those who voted No are happy seeing all these Tory arseholes looking so smug. That's what you voted for. #indyref #Scotland

I now need a JH marathon stat. Will keep me awake for #Indyref results!

Would be interesting, but couldn't see it bugging the SNP.. Unless they got lumbered with the #UK debt. #indyref

#indyref is the absolute epitome of democracy. Proud to be Scottish - showing the World how it's done!

REFERENDUM: We are still here at Ravenscraig And we're still without any notice of turnout or the final result #indyref

#indyref only 2 declarations but looking like the No vote better mobilised. Hang on in there, Yessers!

A recap of what we know - Orkney and Clackmannanshire said no on the #indyref. More results are coming.

As an American I would like to applaud Scotland for their extremely high turnout tonight. The world can take a lesson #indyref.

all Scottish bottles have jobs #indyref

can you send coffee here, also match sticks to keep the eyes open im gripped #impullingthrough #indyref

waiting news from Shetland, after Okrney all in northsea rich oil isles. #indyref if this be a NO it'll be a major bummer to the YEScamp.

we have a history. yes or no, understand the very complicated stakes. #indyref #Scotland

Hey #Scotland, are ye all up a' nicht? #indyref

OOooh, Michael Gove on BBC Scotland! #indyref

We certainly do _not_ hope to be hearing from Michael Gove, Huw Edwards!!! #indyref

How incredibly civilized, to peacefully and orderly vote on whether to break up a country. Certainly not the way it's usually done. #indyref

Owen Jones just came on my TV, good night everybody. #Indyref

Suspicions are raised at a Scottish polling booth. #indyref #DoctorWho

Disappointed that the #indyref hashtag has nothing to do with Indiana Jones running about a football pitch blowing a whistle. #misleading

Is kay burley on #sky news trying to compete with the sky sports news team. She's not leaving much to the imagination.  #bragate #indyref

Alex Salmond and his cult should heed these wise words. #IndyRef

The thunder and lightning over Westminter came from the South Of England, not Scotland #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Anything below 45% now is a poor showing for Yessers. #indyref

yep im here in florida at a much more respectable  time of 8:40 pm good luck Scotland #indyref

Gove!? Ugh. I thought we'd got rid of him for a while. Why Why? #indyref

Scottish referendum live: first results brings gloom to yes camp#indyref #scotlandDecides #live

English votes for English laws won't be welcomed by Labour people Owen.  #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

I'm watching ITV's coverage. It's good, I'm wary of BBC #indyref

says 'not anyone in here can predict this, it's too close to call' #indyref

Labour and the Tories snuggling up together is particularly gut wrenching. #IndyRef

Brilliant job Rachel on #indyref in #Scotland .. so refreshing to get quality cover on this  just wish #YES campaign was winning #maddow

Good God! Michael Gove praising Brown. No voters this is what you signed up for!!!#indyref

I hope so! Fed up w talking. Kay burley is doing her best 2 keep ppl up by walking them around the stadium. I'm dizzy! #indyref

It is way too early to tell but based on early declarations of two small districts we appear to be looking at a No vote. Or not #indyref

#indyref Charlie Rich singing for Eck ~  Life has It's Little Ups and Downs ~

Wow - YES needed 50% in Edinburgh! MT In Edinburgh reports some at count believe cld B up2 60% for NO #indyref

I have a feeling that Owen Jones would love a constitutional crisis. #IndyRef

Gove spilling the beans about who sat off in London while Darling fronted the Legion of Doom for them up north. #indyref

hope more of the results will be announced soon, starting to get tired #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Oh Flower Of Scotland when will we actually see your like again? #Indyref #ScotDecides

Third #indyref declaration: Shetland votes #No (64% No; 36% Yes). Another strong No from the Islands.

It's a big NO from Shetland. Woohoo #indyref

If Yes loses Edinburgh and Aberdeen and Glasgow is a toss-up, what path to victory do they have? #indyref

I think I know how this is gonna go. #Shetland #indyref

Shetland becomes third local authority to say #nothanks. #indyref

I was considering moving to Ireland after uni. Considering it even more now #indyref

Team bonding tonight with Jersey Boys. Keeping a close eye on the #IndyRef vote from across the pond!

Yay, new results- another NO from Shetland  #indyref

We're still busy verifying votes at Williamwood High #indyref

#PM #DavidCameron scheduled to respond to the #indyref results in a #live televised address.

Shetland goes NO by around 4000. Lib Dems know how to surprise. #indyref

Wow! Massive thunderstorm here now, it's not only me that's angry about NO leading so far then!! #indyref

Third result is in - 65.71% of people vote No to Scottish independence in Shetland #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Shetland also votes NO. Going downhill for the independence vote #indyref

Shetland declares for Better Together. 9951 to 5669. Third overall majority for Better Together #indyref

Looking like MSM wasn't as out of step as some critics claimed #indyref

What we need is a constitutional convention say both Polly Toynbee and  We should be debating visions, not tactics! #indyref

Clackmanshire still taking it tight! Haha. Wrong yins #indyref

#indyref is bringing home just how sparsely populated the place is. Slough 2 miles up the road has 140000 pop. A decent size county up there

Shetland votes No, again, not unexpected, but that's closer to what I expected. #indyref

Overall results currently sitting at: 64 - 36 No/Yes #indyref

63 (nearly 64) % No vote is pretty damn definite. #indyref

That bloke seemed really reluctant to make the most of his place in history. #Shetland #indyref

Shetland: independence more popular than the Assembly was in 1979, but a lot, lot less popular than devolution in 1997 #indyref

Either John Swinney is really tall or this reporter is really small #indyref

Seven of the ten people who live in the Shetlands voted no so let us extrapolate this across the rest of Scotland #indyref

36% Yes in Shetland, again, a bit better than I might have thought an hour ago. (But still clearly No overall.) #indyref

Three small mainly remote councils in: Yes 40.8% No 59.2% #indyref #voteyes #voteno #bettertogether

On the basis of two declarations, the final outcome is expected to be (personal calculation): Yes: 32.86% No: 66.99% - #indyref

John swinney, where's he been? Maybe because they don't want him to be asked about the economic question? #indyref

Think it's time for bed.. Good night Scotland, good luck #Indyref #YesScotland #WeCanBeFree

Either way, this #scottishindependence #ScotReferendum #indyref has split #Scotland apart. Will be interesting to see how people move on.

Shetland islanders aren't Scottish anyway. Bunch of Norwegians. Shouldn't have been allowed to vote #indyref

There's a guy at the BT 'party' with a cap on backwards. I knew they were caught in the past but this is a bit much! #indyref #capaffyadafty

No surprises so far, but I do think we're looking at a 55%-45% result in favour of No. #indyref

That's quite a shine John Swinney's got going on his head #indyref

Continuing to adjudicate spoiled ballot papers at Ravenscraig, North Lanarkshire referendum count. No turnout fig yet. #indyref

It's getting off to a good start! #indyref #VoteNo

Currently in LA so will be able to see the final result as it happens #indyref #ScotlandDecides

No from Shetland, but has been teasing results from East Lothian soon. Dilemma - do I go to bed or wait up?! #indyref

Scotland would give away it's independence for a go at Deal or No Deal methinks #indyref

Once upon a time, I decided to leave home and my parents warned me against it but I went anyway. 4 years later, I'm not bankrupt. #indyref

Is it the case that the phrase if you don't know vote no has worked?? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Imagine if I wake up in a few hours and Scotland has actually voted to become independent.. I will defs think it is just a dream #indyref

Shetland the other great Scottish Liberal Democrat heartland has strongly voted No. Excellent! #LibDemNo #LibDems #indyref #ScotlandDecides

dont get me wrong, i'm still hoping for a #yesvote overall, i just wish one yes council would declare already. #indyref #YesScotland

Wondering if I'm the only American dork watching #indyref

Being at a Yes party is rather awkward right now. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Just realised that tensions in campaign are fault of - their Referendum Correspondent is called Laura Bicker! #indyref

Where does Scotland go, after all of this? The pub. #indyref

#Scotland doesnt want to be independent, because they enjoy the easy life #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Earlier, on the Royal Mile in #Edinburgh. Didn't think I really cared, but now I can't sleep. #indyref

This is like a pack of wolves eating me, baws first #Indyref

It *has* been great to see young people involved in politics in the #indyref - so many decisions are made by rich old people.

Liking Humza Yousaf's optimism despite 3/3 declared so far saying No. #indyref #ScotDecides

NO campaign leads by 12 thousand votes after 3 results #indyref

TV showing Bitter Together party, I'd shoot the lot.I don't live in Scotland, so don't need to get along with the wankstains.#indyref

Slow start for #VoteYes in count - but only 1.8% of total vote returned so far - plenty of time guys. #indyref

Shetland Islands says Independence is a baaaaaaaaaaad idea #indyref

Surprised that the Shetland Islands voted No by that much #indyref

Turnout in the #indyref expected to be 84% according to the BBC. An incredible achievement and something that should be celebrated.

Watching #indyref is taking me back to the Quebec referendum I wonder what twitter would have looked like for that vote.

Not going to lie, #indyref is the perfect set-up for an American media SPECTACLE. Shame we're not covering it.

Yes vote looking like it depends on the Scottish cities! #indyref

He didn't say it, but John Swinney is implicitly accepting a win by the Nos #indyref

Michael Gove is on. I'm off to bed. #indyref

Night time feed quick check on what's happening with #indyref thinking of famo and hoping for no vote #bettertogether

Has a Youtube video ever been more apt? #indyref #indyrefallnighter

The Yes campaign should just have been a picture of Michael Gove. Nothing else. Landslide. #indyref

1.7% of electorate total. That's where we are. Just saying. May mean nothing but worth remembering. #indyref

If Alex Salmond gets his way in today's #indyref, my only wish is to see him pay tribute to Freddie in a dress:

Douglas Alexander seems to be gloating that YES didn't break the purdah period like the cheating, lying no camp did. #indyref

#indyref Think if this returns a NO vote i'll be switching to Irish whiskey. At least they have a set of BALLS !

Can't look away but need my bed. #indyref

Cameron to pay tribute to Gordon Brown?? The guy that caused the economic collapse aye? #indyref

#Scotland is full of #RobertTheBruces from #Braveheart rather than #WilliamWallaces We will now take our medicine.#IndyRef

I can't ever quite decide if I think those glasses were a good choice for Michael Gove #indyref #barelyrelevant

Feeling bad for my friends across the pond who are up way past their bedtime. #indyrefallnighter #indyref

Shetland, the island wayyyyy up north near Norway, were expected to vote No. But still a bigger result for them than expected. #indyref

Just oot ma bed to watch the result #feckinnervous #indyref

I visited Edinburgh twice. Lovely city. Liked the swords. #indyref

3 results so far, no surprises on these landing for No. Total population share for the 3 = 1.7% #indyref

By contrast, Labour's Clare Baker in a more cheerful mood. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

unlike Crimea where there was a real threat, scotland is not threatened by London, hence most will vote conservatively #indyref

keep the faith! Yes! expected to lose in these areas :)#VoteYesScotland #indyref

TOTALISER (after three declarations): Yes - 26,902; No - 38,991 #indyref

I really hope Glasgow gives the UK their douze points. #indyref

Four men? Really?? Women can speak for more than 5 minutes you know #indyref

#IndyRef results coming in..shouldn't be surprised, newspapers and BBC advertising win..just hoped Scots would see through the bias

Important to note only 0.01% of Scotlands vote has been announced yet. In stronghold No areas. Excited for the rest of the evening. #IndyRef

Senior Yes Campaign member tells us that #No look like they will come top in #Fife #indyref

Looks like we're seeing where the Undecideds went #indyref

Twitter counts a million more 'Yes' tweets than 'No' in Scottish referendum:  #IndyRef

If the result is no, is it within the Act of Union that they can vote again in x amount of years? Or one off? #indyref #scotland #uk

Can we have the thunderclaps punctuate each result come in, please? #IndyRef

With the media coverage we have had through #indyref , a NO vote isn't surprising #VoteYes

Twitter skelped BBC on the Shetland figures. Too much yackety-yack at key point #indyref

Incredible 84% turn out in #ScottishReferendum #indyref  So far 3 district go #no  Early days

#Gove allowed back on TV now all votes have been cast in #indyref. Expect  same for #election2015. #Gove: not gone  not forgotten. #bbcdp

#indyref half time tune from one of Scotland's best exports

The lovely lady on the setee on ITV has gone.  That's it, Battlefield time. #indyref

Turnout was so good that footballers were announcing that it had reached 110%. #indyref

Continous lightning for about six hours now. #PatheticFallacy. #IndyRef

Why isn't Wolf Blitzer covering #indyref with full gusto? I need crazy maps, daft pundits, and rash predictions, DAMMIT!

Thanks this is the best source I've seen for #indyref results.

Now Perth and Kinross apparently going NO. Says a lot about the SNP's electorate, they haven't forgotten their Tory unionist roots #indyref

Local totals for #Orkney are in:- Yes: 4,883.- No: 10,004.- Rejected: 20.#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Great respect and refrain at the Shetland vote. Mutual respect.  Well done guys. #indyref

I can't help loving the wrestling references, ok?! #indyref

Rene Levesque lost the 1980 Quebec Referendum 60-40, came back and won the next provincial election #indyref

The thing about democratic elections is that there is a 0% chance of everyone being happy in the end. Sure beats a war though. #indyref

The pun wot didn't win it MT In Clackmannanshire they dubbed polling booths 'Aye pods'  #indyref

just imagine wanting to remain a part of a country that gave chris addison a career #indyref

this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. if we don't take this we'll just be wandering what if! #YesScotland #indyref

This is dead easy staying up to watch the count results! #indyref

No even British but anxiously awaiting the #indyref results#newshound

Smaller and more remote districts all seem to be going no. big cities could turn it though #indyref #ScottishReferendum ##ScotlandDecides

Fucking knackered #indyref #ScotlandDecides / good to see good politicians on telly Hello mr gove !

Salmond: 99% will be happy with the result, whatever it is. They just wanted the vote  #indyref

Is anyone actually watching stv/itv coverage? #bbcindyref #indyref

Love seeing Michael Gove obliged to praise Gordon Brown. Tory twat. #indyref

With three councils reporting it looks like Scotland remains in the UK. But those are also three very small councils, so who knows. #indyref

Tonight I'm switching between #ScotlandDecides #indyref coverage on and #ATLvsTB because #FantasyFootball. #dclife

My dog can't understand why we're still on the sofa and awake. She is though more than happy to partake in ref snacks #indyref

An experiment was being done on SnapChat and WhatsApp re #indyref from #c4news. (2/2) #journalism #socialmedia

If the ayes had instead of that preening tart Alex Salmond, it would be all over. #TrueFact #indyref

#indyref #cakeref dark chocolate will need to seriously reconsider tactics before next social occasion.

If, as indicated by SNP before, the Isles don't even get to have their own #indyref - then UK needs to protect THOSE 63-67% NO areas views!

#Gove on #ScotlandDecides said eff off Scotland England Wales and NI. But he said it brilliantly. In that psycho voice of his. #indyref #Yes

How crucial will the 120,000 people who didn't vote in Glasgow be? #indyref

16 year old kid calling out Sky man on his blatant bias WELL DONE SON! 'Er well only three have declared?' #indyref

This is the first time I've ever felt optimistic about a solution to the West Lothian question. Let's have home rule all round. #IndyRef

97% turn out in #indyref great to see so many take an interest no matter what side your on

In ABC News at 12: Security at Parliament House increased. Early counting in Scottish #indyref leaning towards the 'NO' vote. #Canberra #CBR

Feels like an appropriate evening for a glass of Talisker. #indyref

Better Together supporters are looking increasingly confident here at the South Ayrshire count. #jpScotRef #indyref

9 years on a grant at Uni and couldn't get a fucking degree. #indyref

Saw a tweet suggesting 56% Yes in Glasgow. If that happens, the Huff Post model swings to a predicted 43K Yes lead. Glasgow vital. #indyref

The massive voter turnout is extremely positive regardless.Hopefully it'll kickstart an interest in politics across the board #indyref

Saddens me that after all this time people still haven't woken up. #VoteYes #indyref

Rich people vote no to protect themselves, middle vote no because they are scared and poor vote Yes for hope.Isn't Scotland great? #indyref

Just me or does everything say make you do a sick in your mouth? #WorstVoice #indyref #RefTV #YesScotland

Will be interesting to be in Scotland during the aftermarth of #indyref, especially in Glasgow! #ScotlandDecides

Left Jellybaby early to watch the results #indyref #oops

Cicero's on talking global business and investor reactions to #IndyRef

I  guess the No voters are going to love paying for tuition fees and personal care for the elderly #indyref down the line

Its naw :) powers are the middle of a donut! #indyref

Tellys on watching the results.eyes are drooping.com on Scotland we can do it#indyref

If no wins, Eilean Siar should honestly change its name to Illanshire, as islanders seem to have let UK cac all over them #indyref #gaidhlig

What the/where the hell is Elien Siar?? #indyref

Y'know we promised more devolved powers if Scotland voted No in #IndyRef, well you now get to pick your Parliament's new colour scheme!

Obsessed and wish I'd followed this more closely before tonight. First #indyref declaration due soon

Think I might stay up for this. My anxiety is high tonight #indyref

#BetterTogether starting to predict victory yet still around four million votes to play for. #indyref

It's astonishing watching the Westminster Elite talking about the Westminster Elite as if they aren't part of the Westminster Elite#indyref

What the world needs now is additional layers of cynical political self-servitude  a growing army of paid bureaucrats #FFS #indyref

Michael Gove has the same voice as Alex Callinicos.  #indyref

18 years ago had fab work trips to Shetland- Still wonderful people #indyref

Remember Orkney and Dumfries  Galloway voted 'No' in the 1997 referendum too, and the final result was a 'Yes' #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Via Shetland only account for 0.4% of total so only 1.7% or 3 small councils declared. 59% of this voting No. A lot to go #indyref

Only No voters can regret their decision if it is No. Unless Devo Max happens  soon, they'll be responsible for another referendum #indyref

Have Scotland voted for Satan to come down to England or something this thunder is crazy! #thunder #indyref

Yes supporter wipes away tears at Fife count - tears of joy or despair? #indyref

Feeling patriotic but powerless watching the votes come in as a Scot in England #indyref

#indyref English votes for English laws?? What about English mps for English seats. Fuck Gove off the highest part of hadrians wall.

Shetland votes 63.7 saying no! I bet David Camoron is feeling a right smug bastard! #Indyref

Any idea how Renfrewshire came out on #indyref #ScotlandDecides ??No word from cousin  there are free pints riding on the tally.

Wow watching a call live is terrifying #indyref

Yes campaigners sing outside the Scottish Parliament as #indyref count continues

Well I stuck with it until Michael Gove came on and I suddenly felt very tired. I'm sure I'll wake to a 54% no vote #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref 4/32Na h-Eileanan Siar 19,758 - 86.2%YES - 9,195NO - 10,544Link to results page

and so to bed and up in 2 hours for Glasgie #indyref

Eilean Siar result should be a good win for the Yes camp - will soon know #indyref

This bloke clearly doesn't actually speak Gaelic. He's reading this phonetically. #indyref

Eilean Siar cloud seeded to make sure everyone was up and watching their declaration, it's obvious. Scoundrels. #indyref

Check Out My Interview With the Beautiful Hala Maroc #Falcons #ScotlandDecides #indyref #Devin Hester #iOS 8

No longer possible to back a 'No' on betting sites - #indyref

And the Western Isles also says no  this is becoming predictable! #indyref

Hearing it could be a no majority in South Lanarkshire! #indyref

No wins Western Isles.Disappointing.Still, I hear Barra was a Yes island -- that gladdens me.#Indyref #ScotlandDecides

I don't want to see Scotland go #indyref #SaveTheUK

The Nationalists are losing in their own heartland. Huge, huge blow to the Nationalists. #indyref

#indyref Western Isles vote NO - what a result - SNP heartlands reject independence.

It's gonna be a NO win now very disappointing Scotland has just threw away its best chance ever #indyref

Westminster Exclusive: Sound of paper tearing and hoots of laughter reportedly coming from PM's Office #indyref #ScotDecides  #duped

Narrow win for No at the Western Isles, Yes: 9,195 No: 10,544. #indyref

Fire alarm again. Sake Dundee! #indyref

Wow well done the Western Isles!!! Surely Scotland will be staying with us now! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Polling had suggested that Western Isles would have been one of the most likely to vote Yes -- and it has now voted no #indyref

It's not over yet but if the SNP cannot get a Yes majority in a seat they hold in Westminster, they are in major trouble. #indyref

Love hearing the reasons for spoiled ballots in #Indyref. 6 people spoiled ballots in one county by voting for both options. Awesome.

No ahead in the western isle by a few hundred votes  #indyref

Eilean Siar voting No, not a single constituency voting Yes so far means Scotland voting no. Seems to be no question of that now. #indyref

No 4 of 32 - Western Isles votes No by 53.42% in Scotland #indyref, Yes side expected to win

This referendum isn't looking good for independence at the moment. :-( #indyref

Another 6 for Yes and No in the Western Isles. I need to meet these people #indyref

Helicopters will fly in Scottish returns from remote isles, with help from the coast guard  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Incredible result from SNP heartland of the Western Isles - #BetterTogether #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

15 people so far have voted for both answers. I think I'm going to keep track of this all the way through. #indyref

following it in in Philadelphia. Looks all over now for Yes #indyref

Western Isles..you disappoint me #Indyref

Close result in the Western Isles - 1,400 ish 'NO' majority. Still going in the right direction. #indyref #bettertogether

Disappointment from #westernisles close one though. Tiny constituency clearly effected by #ProjectFear! #indyref #RefTV #YesScotland

#bettertogether leads #indyref 57.8 to 42.2 which is good news for geography challenged Americans We can still lump all the UK together!

I'm now wishing I'd gone to bed now, the results are so depressing!! #indyref

As the first results trickle through a crash of thunder and the heavens open, No edges the opening salvo #indyref

I have to reiterate. The total number of votes coming from Glasgow outnumber all the reported councils thus far. Too early to call. #Indyref

heartlands my friend! The heart of Scotland! #indyref

I know there's a long way to go yet, but realistically, yes have lost ithaven't they? #indyref

That's it Western isles, Shetland and Orkney, voted NAY, Salmond is thereby a liar to the scots, there's no oil after independence #indyref

Western Isles about a Nationalistic as they come. They voted No #voteNo #indyref

Another result in favour of the no vote, I am pleased to say. #bettertogether #indyref

No voters cannot complain about what happens if we stay in the Union. Just putting that out there. #VoteYesScotland #indyref

Maybe scotland wants independence because england did so bad in the world cup #indyref

Surprise NO declaration from #EileanSiar YES 9,195 NO 10,544 86.2% turnout #indyref #Scotland

Really wish I was pissed in some laird's castle right now. #indyref

Low turnouts in Glasgow (75%) and Dundee (78.8%) harm the Yes campaign. They needed high turnouts there to win #indyref #indyts

Haha BBC rushes Mike Forsyth onto the panel after they realise they'd put on with two rampant Yessers! #indyref

Surprising result from Western Isles! Good to see No retaining a good lead. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

If I hear one more person use the phrase 'direction of travel' I may explode. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

All 4 results called for NO so far, YES not getting the % they would need even in these small authorities? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

The Western Isles say no? Say it ain't so #indyref

Bit of a lull in proceedings here at #dumgalcount.  Yes campaigners are looking a bit glum.  #indyref

Dundee fire alarm goes off again! #indyref

Listening to results role in for #Scotland from a wee island in the #SalishSea 3-NO, 0-YES, 29 to go #indyref #nailbiting #GoodLuckScotland

Is anyone getting bored of the word 'caveat' being mentioned frequently in the coverage so far. Look in a thesaurus people ! #indyref

I am looking for a yes voter or no voter to comment on piece once final result is declared. Pls tweet/email ale #indyref

Hold the bus Are we counting chickens now? #indyref

Edinburgh, Glasgow  Aberdeen, with 25% of registered voters, to announce results last, between 5am  6am. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

BALAMORY SAYS NO. they just killed Bambi. Cinderella goes home. #indyref

Well scots are now dead forever! Break us up split what's left of us! #indyref

I'm assuming all this thunder and lightning means that the Scottish results are in #indyref

Now in terms of actually winning parts of the country, even Yes to AV was doing better than this!  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Close votes, but lookin' good for the ol Union Jack so far. Still a lot of districts to go #indyref

Just imagine what US elections could produce with 87% voter turnout. #indyref

Stirling is now looking likely delayed until 3.45am. To be expected with the exceptionally high turnout. #indyref

The voting was cast, in person or by mail,In hopes that togetherness, soon would prevail(2/2)#IndyRef

Another blow to the #YES campaign. The #WesternIsles was expected to go to them. Still a long night ahead. #IndyRef #ScottishReferendum

Wow. So now they're saying Dundee is going to be a No?! #indyref

The news on #Scotland ! A No Victory Declared all over news channels before any regional counts had been declared ! work that out #indyref

It's looking clear that secret No's may have felt cautious about admitting No publicly, but not for voting No at the ballot box. #indyref

#indyref WTF is going in Dundee? Not 1 but 2 evacuations of a counting centre due to fire alarm?

The official turnout in Aberdeenshire is 87.2%, with 180,045 votes cast. #indyref

Well If nothing else, #indyref caused me to watch for the first time in my life is showing Kitchen Nightmares!

No 53% 47% Yes Eilean Siar  a huge surprise based on political history #indyref

Why #indyref result in council level, result should be declared in total. Dividing the country in result. its not good

Truly, regardless of #indyref results, there's no more beautiful place than Scotland

Sir Menzies Campbell joins us.. #indyref

The turn out is remarkable and something I only wish we could replicate in England. #indyref

I was watching the #indyref with great interest until Michael Gove came on then I nodded off. Someone shut him up.

On a boat in the middle of the Pacific, but keeping up-to-date with #indyref - whichever side wins, the high turnout in #Scotland is great

What is wrong with you, Western Isles?? :( #indyref

Eilean Siar result. No vote leading 4-0 and 49.5k to 36k in #indyref

if it's true that Fife has gone No then this thing is over. #indyref

What do we do? Leave Scotland and adopt a new nation? Or stay and fight?  #indyref #VoteYes

When do the international observers arrive?#IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Virgin box randomly rebooted, saving me from hearing any more from Blair McDougall thankfully #Indyref #scotdecides

Wow. Couldn't even win Western Isles. I await the Adam Curtis documentary on how a rogue poll panicked an entire political class. #indyref

We have just heard a No vote announced in Gaelic. That emphatic, I could almost go to bed. Almost. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides #BetterTogether

When all is said, it's your fellow countrymen and women voting No. Disappointing but it 's democracy. #indyref

the no campaign confident of 55-45 after declarations play out as samples suggested. #indyref

Wow, even SNP heartland Eilean Siar (Western Isles) votes no (53.4%).  Looks a bad night for Yes campaign. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Not looking good but either way very impressive turnout #indyref

Can anyone predict when the final result will be known? Choice of putting TV on for an hour or napping for couple of hours first ? #indyref

To be honest, a turnout of 80% would be an embarrassment for a country where its sovereignty is on the line. #indyref

I'd enjoy seeing a Belfast #indyref vote

Get used to your National anthem (GSTQ) ringing round that shithole after today. Your Queen watches over us! #indyref

But two of them were expected to be yes. #indyref

A very important day to #Scotland and to the world Awaiting for the results #indyref I wished the turnouts in Portugal were that big.

What 'status quo has magnetic appeal in referenda' in UK or internationally would that be? #indyref

Pretty annoying that Huw Edwards talked over the turnout numbers when the were announced in Gaelic in Eilean Siar #indyref

That Western Isles result is big disappointment for who's been one of most vociferous Tweeters for Yes campaign #indyref

Never forget YeSNP endorsed  distributed his vile propaganda lies in their shops #indyref

#indyref Why is everybody chatting as if it is a No vote already? Since 10pm? Still with the #bbcbias ?

Whatever the result, Scotland has an energized nation. Voter turnouts in the 90s! #indyref

what are you playing at. Honour all those that have died in name of freedom for Scotland!  Declaration of Arbroath. 1320#indyref

I thought I was the only crazy person still up #notwatching #indyref so no excuse

Not looking good for the Yes Camp, Shetland Isles declare No, Overall polls YES 42.15% NO 57.85  #Indyref #YesScotland #NoScotland

I think youll find that it will be a win 60/40 overall win to the No #indyref .

Did anyone have OJ Simpson on the #indyref bingo??

Who are these people voting both yes and no?? It's a 50/50 decision it's really not that difficult. #indyref

28 Councils left. Come on, rest of Scotland!! #YesScotland #indyref #indyrefallnighter  There's some #nailbiting and #hairpulling up in here

In other #indyref news, my Asda Smart Price sandwich is as underwhelming as the photograph suggested.

Thanks for the #FF  compliments! And Happy #Indyref to our Scottish friends!

I like how the West Lothian question is finally bring brought to the forefront! #indyref  #overdue

think the Dundee lot need to get that alarm checked. hmmm  bit sus if u ask me  #indyref

Dennis the menace seems to be having some fun in Dundee with the fire alarm! #indyref #YesScotland #ScotlandDecides #indyrefallnighter

Fuckin Margaret Curran on TV. If Johann Lamont appears then I'm throwing a bottle at my telly. #indyref

not a surprise. #indyref has woken up England

Ok one thing America does rule in -- we count votes way fasterthank goodness #indyref

An English assembly would leave the north of England in the same Tory hell as a 'yes' vote. #indyref

So proud of Scotland - an engaged and passionate nation. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

A pearly queen mate just text to say the South's getting the worst thunder  lightening of her young life. England kicking off re. #IndyRef?

So, 4 electorate results in  all 4 have voted NO. I'm sensing a pattern here  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I think Alex Salmond is gonna have time on his hands after the next few results, he will probably do it #indyref

can't even change channel to watch the footbal that's just as much of a slam dunk #IndyRef

Follow the results of the Scottish #indyref from each of the 32 electoral districts:

I really hope this can be pulled back to a yes vote!! #indyref

You have to say this analysis from of why Scotland would vote NO looks like proving spot-on #indyref

Ming Campbell brilliant on the West Lothian question. 'Scots should should determine shape of English self determination'. #indyref

Scotland's only UKIP seat holder looks like Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs #indyref

Watching coverage of #indyref. Lots of chat about federalism. As an American, I have one piece of advice: don't do it. Doesn't work

Urgency, Gove? Or flying by the seat of your pants to rush everything devo-ish thru before #ge2015? #indyref

MT Result looks disappointing. But losing energymotivation of people re-engaged in politics would be even worse. #indyref

I better start shopping for my  health insurance. Privatised NHS coming to a town near you very soon. #indyref

reporting 57.85% No, 42.15% Yes. Given recent polls this is an unexpected early disparity! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Have they superimposed a suit onto this fella's chins here? #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I respect #Scotland. I understand the #indyref. I get it. But the nations and peoples of the UK are better/stronger together than apart.

David Coburn of UKIP. Get to fuck. #Scotland #indyref

Low turnout in the 1997 Yes strongholds is hurting the pro-independance camp. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

The promises made (for us) in the lead up to the #indyref have shown even more weakness on David Cameron's part. Allow us some pride please!

Why are BBC allowing this dreadful UKIP fella to pollute my TV screen with his stupidity #indyref

Anyone else keeping track of the Scotland vote? #ScotlandDecides #indyref plenty of big electorates still be decide!

I feel for Scotland now. They need a Yes win. Too many pissed off English won't let this lie #ScotlandDecides  #indyref

My connection to Scotland ended 300 or so years ago. But. C'mon. Why not Yes? #Indyref

#IndyRef Its looking like we will have a currency union.. along with a social one, a political one and an economic one.

Yes and we are nutters for doing so too! #indyref

When I said #bettertogether, I should clarify - that didn't include #indyref

4/32 declared puts NO on an early lead. Yes 42%  No 58% #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Wow. Blue Nun is actually quite nice! was right all along! Works at 3am with toffee popcorn and rising hopes of a NO #indyref #bbctw

giving time to on #indyref and again they being racist and scots are voteing no agrees with him #indyref

It's the highlight of the evening so far! #indyref

Night feeds made slightly more exciting by watching #indyref  results.

I've never been to Scotland but I'm following the vote tallying like I live there! #indyref #scottishindependence

UKIP Huy days SNP racist party #indyref

Yes voters are so paranoid this morning. People do not like intimidation and threats. #indyref

Tonight we are watching while listening to and eating Chinese food and drinking Scottish whisky. #NFL #indyref

BBC coverage of #indyref turned into a stupid fucking UKIP vs everyone as usual - piss off.

UKIP and SNP are having a fight about who is the racist party over on the BBC. #indyref

Awoken by terrifying #Thunderstorm. Sounded like the end of the United Kingdom #indyref

.refresh.refresh #indyref live results on interactive map:

If Scotland taught us anything it's that Scots are 1000% better at the democratic process of voting than we are. #indyref

Might be a silly question - but why didn't they just count the votes as they went along today?? #indyref

I never said that and you know it #indyref #VoteYes

also welcomed positive #indyref campaign led by yes. Hope this continues for whatever is best for Scotland post-ref

When people have been subservient so long, and told 'they can't', it takes courage to change. A leap of faith #indyref poll

Oh I'm sorry: UKIP calling anyone racist. Fucking hell. #bbcindyref #indyref

Counting Officer Tracey Logan carries out adjudication with agents for Yes and No camps #indyref

I like to think of Alex Salmond more like David Moyes, he tried and he failed. #indyref

David Steele is in favour of home rule for everywhere after 2 years of supporting the opposite for his home country.#indyref

Has #indyref created an informed, engage electorate? Yes, say Scots. No really, say overseas observers:

Only reason I'm watching #BBC is to see the epic #monsterthroatfucking will give them when #voteyes wins #indyref

#Yes and #no. at least, unlike Quebec!!, they made the question simple. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

4 declared. 4 no. Still a long way to go but No has made a strong. Right now a UKIP nut case is talking crap as per. #indyref

Oh fuck off UKIP, no one cares what you think.#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Failed, I forgot #indyref snacks and now I'm starving #indyrefallnighter

you forgot to put the counter on Alaska #indyref

Well this spat has cheered things up. Coburn is a nincompoop. #Indyref

If yes wins uk will be alaughing stock lol #indyref

Hats off to sky news. Some laughs in here #indyref

This is shit. Democracy sucks. Violent Revolution is the only way, Scotland. What is this, Amateur Hour? #indyref #ScotlandDecides #boring

well that #ukip representative was classically arrogant and uninformed #indyref

Former SNP MSP already predicting he'll be taking the weekend to lick his wounds #indyref

This UKIP Scottish MEP is an utter idiot. He illustrates how dangerous these right wing loonies are #indyref

This Bos Nas character is a PR disaster for UKIP. #indyref

I'm watching too between channel hopping. #indyref #indyrefallnighter #bettertogether #VoteNoScotland

Scotland is now into the 2 hour declaration period in the results will come in thick and fast #indyref #ScotlandDecides

If you've unfollowed me because of the #indyref i'm oh sO SORRY FOR BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT MY COUNTRY'S FUTURE XO

It takes hell lot of a sense of confidence in a country to allow plebiscite in one part of it. Scotland's #indyref is the example from UK.

I do wish Ricky Ross would stop saying Britain doesn't have a constitution. We do. He just doesn't like the form that it's in. #Indyref

Brief THIRD fire alarm at dundee count. This time wasn't suspended. This is too suspicious. #indyref

#Scotland: First YES victory.  Count of the piles suggests 52,000 yes to 41,000 no #indyref #ScotDecides

Early results pointing to a victory for the No side. #scottishindependence #indyref

Did this UKIP man just refer to the colonies in a statement about how he is not racist?  #indyref

Think they have started on the whiskey a bit early. Its already over. Disappointing but time to move on and work together #indyref

If the #indyref was a poll,#YesScotland would have won as the #Yes campaign had more positive tweets

Was about to go to bed but am now incensed by UKIP loon. And that the results seem to have dried up. #indyref

I can't believe I've set my alarm and actually got up to check how the results are going #indyref

'The silent majority are at last being heard!' Our heraldscotland #indyref forum

Oh, God, the UKIP fucker's back. And now he's accusing the SNP of being racist. #indyref

has been off my screen for far too long now! #indyref

#indyref #ScotlandDecides Shocked by Nationalist antics, but very proud to be watching British democracy in action.

The BBC have been teasing all night, but here come the Conservatives and UKIP party members. Look what you may have done Scotland. #indyref

Indeed. R my main worry about scotland's #indyref is that hogwarts will no longer be in the UK if the yes vote wins

Yes, Scotland has high voter turnout but goodness it's slow counting. #indyref

Feeling for all my Scottish brothers and sisters from Canada#indyref

Can't take it in a vote Cilval war anybody? We will get dragged into many more May aswell cause one! #indyref

If Yes wins can this national holiday become real please?  #indyref

No voters have turned out more than Yes seems to be the story #indyref

#indyref actually embarrassed at being a fifer 45/55 no. Turkeys voting for Christmas comes to mind in an area like fife.

Turnout for Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar is 86.2% #indyref #ScotDeclaration

When will many Scots deeply begin to regret their NO vote: after British elections or after EU referendum? #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Gutted. My Scottish father would have been heart-broken :'(  #indyref

wait, so someone else in Mississippi is watching the #indyref too?

Also thinking is doing a great job over all the various channel tonight. #indyref

This #indyref has turned into a heavy 'pull ma nightie doon when yer done' situation. I'm goin to sleep horrible let down guys

North LAN expects to declare around 4.30am #indyref

BBC has brought on American diplomat, I believe to make dribbling UKIP guy look less retarded. #indyref #Scotland

If we had a turnout like this in the general elections I bet we wouldn't have a Conservative government #indyref

Body language of Yes and No camps very telling at The Citadel where No heading for around 60% #indyref

For once, I actually agree with the US' take on politics. But then, they have half a brain more on the economy  business #obama #indyref

My country has got to be better than this, too feart tae no' be feart. Scotland the brave my arse. #indyref

#indyref what will Scottish Labour voters feel if they don't win next UK General Election? Main aim was always 2 deliver more social justice

Forget sports, the #indyref is what really gets me going. This is more exciting than any politics I've ever watched. And I'm American.

Four of thirty two councils called. Still all to play for. Remember that. #indyref

Feels too much like the 2nd of January.#IndyRef

I tried, Scotland. I really tried. But only 4 of 28 #indyref results in at 3:30 am local time. I've gotta pack it in.

do you not fancy a wee shot on could do with a wee laugh #indyref #getkevonthetellt

I fucking loved #Bare as much as I hate the cunts who have banged on about #indyref and not #BellShooting

Scotland #IndyRef - with x/32 councils (x% of eligible voters) it's:Yes 40.8%No 59.2%Turnout: 86.4%

I just woke up. How the hell am I supposed to get back to sleep? #indyref

Big thing to take from this. If the rest of the UK has this turnout, UKIP, Cons gov certainly wouldn't be a thing #indyref

I think tomorrow morning I will read about the #scottishindependence results why eating an English muffin. #indyref

I like Jim. He seems like a sensible grounded politician. A rare treat. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

BBC has American spokesperson on for US opinion on #indyref and he just goes on about how a split would impact US bombing campaigns.

Has Scotland ever, in last 10 or 20 yrs been this important in world? #indyref #Yes find me a time. Apart from the airport thing. Go again.

Brian Taylor loving the whole teal/fuchsia thing. #indyref

Met Jim Murphy and he was unbelievably impressive, he's even more so now. #indyref

Also been making some themed cards for this seemed appropriate #indyref

#Inverness #indyref Looks like they are still in the pub in Inverness, so nothing new there then, either party

For science I should find out if scotch whisky tastes the same pre  post #indyref

Anyone want to celebrate independence or the union come to castle close!#indyref

Early indication, Renfrewshire has said NO. No official result yet but high fives and hugs amongst better together #indyref

Everyone caring about Scotland for the first time in their lives tonight #indyref #scotforlife

I get the feeling loads of places will declare at same time - news producers won't know where to cut to! #indyref

Inverclyde has also backed No. Incredible. #indyref

Who keeps setting off the fire alarm in Dundee? #indyref

Glued to the blog. It's an easy place for me to get the latest from the #indyref as I watch from America.

Day off watching #indyref results come in, sat in British  Irish Lions Jersey with bottle of depleting scotch in hand hoping for the best!

David Cockburn, UKIP. Who's owning up to that? #indyref

Let's get back to sanctioning/cutting/capping poor/disabled's benefits  forcing people out of their homes  to eat from food banks #IndyRef

Inverclyde, my council and home, votes no #indyref

Can't get much closer than that #indyref

Hats off to the Scottish regions for their gorgeous results announcements backdrops. Whatever the result, Scottish tourism wins. #indyref

It's a No vote from Inverclyde with 27,329 compared to 27,243 Yes votes #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Need some good news soon #indyref

How can not have David Dimbleby leading the coverage on such a historic night?! Missing Dimbleby bigtime! #indyref #scotdecides

Inverclyde: No win by 86 votes out of over 54,000 cast! Finally some excitement. #indyref

i dont want to go back to work, i feel unempowered, i feel like everything has been for nothing and nothing will ever change #indyref

I just saw Iain Gray looking sad on the BBC there. It almost made me feel wistful. #indyref

WOAH. No just scrapes it by less than 100 votes in Inverclyde. I would have predicted strong Yes there. I think that is v. telling #indyref

Sitting at my desk watching the #indyref in little old NZ!  Nail-biting stuff and I think it will be down to the wire!

Wow, only 86 votes difference in Inverclyde. That's close. #indyref

i just really want to know the east lothian results #indyref

The Clyde supported NO because they know that ship building relies on the United Kingdom defence spending. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

It's the World Cup all over again - I get the general contours, but in truth have no idea what the hell they're talking about. #indyref

Big day in Scotland, got the Indy vote on TV and had to get the Kilt on at work here in Sydney #YesScotland #indyref

Incredibly tight results from  Inverclyde #indyref

Video: Crowds chant 'we want independence' in Glasgow as they await #indyref result

Oh jeez. Wouldn't like to be in Inverclyde tomorrow - and def wouldn't like to be one of those who spoiled papers!  #indyref 0.2% in it!

#Scotland needs a spank after this! Acting like 2million spoiled brats! #bringbackLongShanks #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

im so heartbroken beyond words. if the results are correct, fear has won over and profit had won over people. cant believe it #indyref

5/5 have voted in favour of no. Still a long way to go. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Less than 100 votes difference in the Inverclyde vote, 0.2% of a majority.  I keep telling myself go to bed but it's addictive #indyref

Wow.. less than a hundred vote-difference in Inverclyde another for the No campaign. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

It's turning out to be a disaster for Scotland. It'll take many years to recover.#indyref

Dear Putin, This is how democracy works. #indyref

86 votes between No and Yes in Inverclyde. Things just got interesting in #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Trying not to just sit here hitting refresh on the #indyref live results site:  #f5 #f5 #f5

Nobody seems to realise that the useless machinations of UK politics tend to result in nothing positive happening. #indyref

wow Inverclyde, not even 100 votes in it but #bettertogether just wins out #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Still hectic here at in Glasgow. Heading for no vote so far. Results and updates on blog at  #indyref

Just got such a sadness when that last result was read #indyref #ScotDecides

The team in Inverclyde should be so proud of their GOTV operation. #bettertogether #indyref #BBCIndyRef

REMEMBER. Whatever result comes today, it is a democratically legitimate one and the people of Scotland MUST stand by it. #indyref

Inveryclyde win with very small margin. a middle ground so always expected. #nothanks still took it though #indyref #bettertogether

No campaign win Inverclyde by just 86 votes in an electorate of 54,601 - closest result of the night. 5-0 though to better together #indyref

NO wins Inverclyde by just 86 votes. As they say every vote counts.  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#Indyref flying through TweetDeck way too fast to follow

Inverclyde a very close one. No wins by barely 100 votes. #indyref

Rest easy, Ginger Spice. Your wardrobe is safe. #indyref #UnionJack

Also, please note my earlier tweet. Moray. I'm disappointed. Let down, even. #naefish #naeboats #buckiewhit #scotdecides #indyref

Should I be happy I can follow the #IndyRef results via Sky News on my Apple TV, or be annoyed that I have to watch Sky News? #fb

Inverclyde a FANTASTICALLY close call, 86 in it. Every single vote counts. Another No victory. #indyref

Fifth #indyref declaration: Inverclyde votes #No by a whisker (50.1 No; 49.9% Yes)

Inverclyde voted no by just 86 votes. Think about that: Such a close race. #indyref

I think i just saw harry potter? #indyref

I think is officially qualifies as a close vote. #indyref

#indyref looks like victory for FEAR over self belief, shame! not for me but for Scotland's future. Let's watch WM MPs backslide on promises

Scotland #IndyRef with 5/32 councils (3.8% of eligible voters)Yes 45.2%No 54.8%Turnout: 86.8%

Inverclyde that was ridiculously close, right result in the end, good on ya! #indyref #VoteNo

Right things aren't looking great #indyref

#Inverclyde result goes #No 50.1 - #Yes 49.9, this may be a very long night for Scotland in route to discovering the results #indyref

Taking names  will be dealing out my own brand of justice later. ;) #JudgeJuryAndExecutioner #ShutUp #IndyRef #CrawlBackIntoYourHoleMaggot

Is it conceivable yet that 'No' could win every local authority? #IndyRef

Inverclyde has voted NOVery very close  #indyref #bettertogether #ScotlandDecides

Inverclyde 50.1% NO 49.9% YES.It's gettin sticky now :-#IndyRef #ScotDecides

mentions hanging chads in Florida.  International embarrassment for years to come  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Proud of inverclyde,  proud of Scotland,  proud of Britain #indyref

Western Isles, Shetland, Inverclyde say no. Great seeing level of democratic engagement from new young voters #indyref #historyinthemaking

Great coverage man,  have you stuck your head in the Phoenix bar, think they open allnight? #goodpub #indyref

Inverclyde declares No with 50.1%, closest result so far. #bettertogether #indyref

Hing yer heids in shameThe baw is stuck in the slates#indyref

And Inveclyde, near Glasgow, goes NO by slim margin. YES hopes really dimming now, need a large margin victory in Glasgow.  #indyref

No vote in Inverclyde very closely nudges out the yes - 50.1% with 87% turnout #indyref

You just KNOW there are 87 Yes voters KICKING themselves in Inverclyde right now. #IndyRef #indyrefallnighter

Dundee next. YES expected to win with about 55%. #indyref

Totally. Instead, we should obsess about a mobile phone, praying at the feet of an old white guy high-fiving Bono. #indyref

Well voted almost half of Inverclyde !   #indyref

Very close for Inverclyde BBC is reporting a margin of 86 votes. #indyref

Current predicted Yes %: 46.12% (95% Bayesian CI: 41.59% - 51.5%) down from 46.74% after Western Isles #indyref

Interesting view.  If it keeps going this way, the yays will have it  #indyref

WOAH so close with Inverclyde #indyref yikes.

would say that #indyref will make a difference to the squad, but the Fletcher starting fairly unlikely anyway

Looks like the Union will remain intact #indyref

The #novote has claimed 5 from 5 council areas so far in the #indyref.#ScotlandDecides #referendum #VoteYes #VoteNo

Counting coming to a halt at South Ayrshire count - result soon? #indyref

It's been 20 minutes. Surely another fire alarm is due. #indyref

Scotland currently voting for Tory austerity. Never thought I'd see the day #indyref

Really flagging now, might need a can of Irn Bru and a deep fried Mars bar to get me through the night #indyref

Twitter is still the best place for live news.  On Everything.  Period.#indyref

I'm not sure the Nos realise the really hard work might start for them tomorrow. They need to to deliver if the vote is No. #indyref

Not surprising. Urban areas (young voters) seem to vote for leaving the #uk #Scotland #indyref

86 votes in it in Inverclyde; I don't think I'll ever see anything that close to a draw in politics ever again in my lifetime! #indyref

So there have been three fire alarms in Dundee with ballots left unattended each time? That seems, erm, dodgy? #indyref

I wish y'all had done exit polls to dissect this #indyref. Oh well, I'll phone my cousins in Ayrshire to get a feel.

This is just the beginning. Let's take this appetite for democracy and work for change  #indyref

#indyref look at Peston's luxurious bouffant. Beautiful #ScotlandDecides

Sounds like is getting the fuck out of here before the no vote goes through #indyref

I am thinking we need a Noraid Salmond Tracker #indyref

Hurumph. I've decided to go to my place of comfort in times of adversity and disquiet; hello Absolute Radio 90s #indyref

With all this excitement over #indyref can't wait for 2017!

At this point I'd rather CBS cut to Scotland so we can see them count the #indyref votes.

My shallow theory stands.The bigger the electorate,the more likely a YES #YesScotland #indyref #ScotlandDecides

An early hours electric storm has just sent 4 car alarms off. Yup. Still awake #indyref

#indyref Sadly, looks like it's all going to hell. Very sad here right now.  FB:

Ian Mackenzie on BBC after alledgedly being thrown out of a polling station earlier I see #indyref

Much is being made of poor/deprived areas + their vote - why are they deprived!! Worse still. Why would they actually vote No? #indyref

BBC reports Salmond has hopped on a private jet out of Aberdeen. #indyref

Inverclyde went 50-50%.  suggests 50% is needed by YES to hit 50% nationwide. #indyref 1st district to hit benchmark

These #indyref numbers It is so exciting to watch history unfold.

Keep in mind only 3.76% of ballots have been counted so far, with 96.24% of #IndyRef voters to be heard - stay tuned! #ScotlandDecides #CNN

The first five areas to declare results in Scotland's #indyref have voted to stay in the UK

I cant sleep , as the future of my native country hangs in the balance. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

This Scottish referendum is like transfer deadline day all over again #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Glad to see the #indyref votes going so well for 'no', though Inverclyde was so close (86 votes). #bettertogether

FM escapes on a plane from Aberdeen - heading to his friend nice Mr Putin? #indyref

No campaigners standing and laughing here. Yes campaigners sitting, one or two already leaving. #eastrencount #indyref #ReferendumLive

Chin-up Yes campaign, at least you're ahead in my poll #indyref

#indyref Should we keep this tune for the Dundee vote? BBC are in a lull , so why not now?  #Scotlandtunes

Can you imagine if Wales ever decides to vote on independence? I'd pay to see Americans try to pronounce Welsh city names #indyref

Has anybody said already that 'the referendum in Dundee is on fire'? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

How drunk are the Better Together people? #indyref

Inverclyde result is 86 vote majority for #VoteNo . Will this be the closest result of the #indyref ?

.. thanks got my hopes up. not the first yes - 50.08% no. damn. #indyref

#ScotlandDecides and the world is waiting. But are they listening to what's being said? #indyref

Falkirk adjudication is done! We are expecting the result 'not too long from now' #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Looks like 3.7million Scots voted.55% No 45% Yes after 5 counts. #indyref

Scottish referendum results: NO: 54.82% / YES: 45.18% - More from  #IndyRef

Pretty much relying on huge #voteyes wins in Dundee/Glagow for any chance here #indyref

Looks like a clear win for No in the #indyref.  Margin likely to be around 9%

Was always going to be a tight race. Still way too early to call #indyref

#Indyref Cumbernauld mermaid behind Adam Boulton is a bad advert for this beautiful country

Also Americans watching #indyref this was partly driven by a little known group The Lemon Party. You should go to their web site.

Imagine the change we would have if we #pluggedin like the Scots have! Voter turn out was mindblowing!#indyref

Is this a rare tweet tonight that isn't about #indyref ?

Alex Salmond jets off on a private jet. Who pays for this? Just think of the money that's been wasted on this campaign. #indyref #Scotland

Atlanta TDs 7, Scottish regions voting No 5. Seems a better matchup. #TNF #indyref #Falcons #Bucs

Riddoch pointing out that No Camp 'vow' was never subjected to scrutiny, just reported. Brings us back to need for media change. #indyref

Flower of Scotland should be retired if the outcome goes as it has done so far. Perhaps replaced by Scotland the Feart #indyref

Hey have you went to the YES camp even once???? Bunch of bias bastards. #indyref

Looking forward to attempt at some very Scottish names tomorrow on Who knew #indyref would be so fascinating?

I would love it if Salmond lost on his own patch, come on Sis! #IndyRef

John Oliver Nails Scottish Independence  via #indyref #scottishindependence

Looks like labour can breathe a sigh of relief. Scotland voting to stay in union saved their existence. #indyref

Well you haven't missed much. Kay Burley is still annoying to watch! #indyref

WOW. Just 86 votes -- 86! -- gave #indyref in Inverclyde a NO. Who says your vote doesn't mean anything? #ScotlandDecides

Private Jet! I'm sure a few food banks could benefit from how much that's costing #indyref

#indyref well enjoyed wearing my kilt tonight. Thanks to my Scottish grandfather.

Labour MP Thomas Docherty gives James Johnstone his reaction to apparent No win in Fife. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

BBC STOP THINKING THAT GOVE HAS ANY OPINION THAT MATTERS! #IndyRef

Anyone else tutting at the councils that are over an hour past their estimated vote delivery? #indyref

So the Scottish First Minister has just left Aberdeen .. In a private jet. Who's paying for that ? #animalfarmmoment #indyref

Couldn't fit a piece of A4 between Inverclyde result! Deary me! #indyref

Alex sammond must be having a shite evening #indyref

Robert (pronounced Row bear pays-TON) should have been cast as Yves Saint Laurent in the biopic.#IndyRef

So gutted at the moment. Scotland has bottled it! #Indyref

Consensus at our wee party that looking like Matt Damon in Harris tweed advert #indyref

#indyref what do you think? RT for yes, fab for no

#Scotland i hope you like your tax $ goin to fund war, dronestrikes and killing of innocents in the Middle East #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I'll bet Quebec is watching this closely. #Scotland #indyref

SCOTTISH IS.  #indyref  Loved it, but remember a few Scotsmen thought it was Eng trying to frame THEIR culture.

Evidently too wee, too stupid  soon to be too poor #disappointing #indyref

What 'more money'? As far as I'm aware the No parties only promised to maintain the current settlement #indyref

Who's staying up to find out if Scotland is an independent country tomorrow? #indyref

BBC showing Obama during Referendum coverage, Comic Relief? #indyref

Yes campaign very cleverly using Man Utd champions league final tactic, 2 goals in the last minute #indyref doesn't appreciate this

Inverclyde - who has voted NO - is now trending Worldwide #IndyRef

Why are we validating this system Scotland :( :( #indyref

In this #indyref campaign New Labour and their supporters put the party before Scotland. We are now looking at another Tory term of office

I have work at 8amthis is worse than during the Australian open #sleepisfortheweak #indyref

No is looking quite strong in Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire at the moment. This is looking quite interesting. #indyref #scotdecides

No campaigners very confident they have a majority in South Lanarkshire #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Not disputing momentum. My issue is in reporting events as news before they happen. No big cities declared yet #indyref

Voted Yes for BCTF vote  would vote Yes for Scotland. #bced #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

RT do it for Scotland Glasgow! Dont lose hope people #indyref  THIS!!!

Wide awake so may as well watch #indyref results.

Still not enough votes in the #indyref for me to know either way. What I do know though is that America does not give one fuck.

First YES win of the night from Dundee.. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Yikes big win for Yes in Dundee. #indyref

The only time you can literally vote your way to freedom. #indyref

Just checking -- #indyref is decided by popular vote, not some sort of electoral college? Confused by declarations.

#ScottishReferendum - Dundee votes YES: first win for the YES side. 57% vs 43% NO #Scotland #independence #ScotlandDecided #indyref

Reaction from an Edinburgh casino to the first Yes result #indyref

Some 4.3 million Scots voted; returns come to around 3.8% so far. Just for perspective. #indyref

Tonight, Scots are tweeting about #indyref. Meanwhile, Sho Funaki is tweeting about #INDEEDref.

Loud cheers from Yes campaigners as dundee reveal 57% yes vote. #Glasgow #indyref

First Yes vote! From Dundee, as expected #indyref

Renfrewshire makes it six from six for the 'Better Together' campaign. #indyref  #Scotland

Dundee, be prepared for the whole of Scotland to arrive #indyref

Things just got interesting again. #indyref

Seventh result (of 32) from Dundee: YES 57% - NO 43%. First big win for Yes, but widely expected. Comparatively low turnout of 79%. #IndyRef

Thank You for securing a Yes Result in the city of Dundee. Lets hope more declarations turn out the same way. #indyref

This Scotland #indyref thing is fascinating to watch. Canada should vote about separating from something. Bieber, maybe?

Council area of Dundee has voted #YES in the #indyref.Yes: 53,620No: 39,880The first win for the #yesvote!#ScotlandDecides

We always knew Dundee was stupid #indyref

Holy crap. I think Dundee voted yes, but the twitter stream is running too fast. 57% yes, (53,620 to 39,800) #indyref

Got woken up by the #storm. All so ominous considering results of the Scotland #indyref is gonna be announced in the morn #bettertogether

So what's more likely Bucs comeback tonight or Yes vote win? #IndyRef

#dundee join #Clackscount in being my favourites this evening. #indyref #spoiltballotanalysis

Everyone knew Dundee was voting Yes, but seeing the low turnout there is a good thing on the whole. #indyref

Dear Scotland, I have to be on the boat early tomorrow. Please decide faster. Thanks. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Omg omg so tense and keep eating biscuits #indyref

49.09% yes! and 50.91% no. that's pretty damned close #indyref #ScotDecides #VoteYesScotland #VoteNoScotland

As long as it's Delta and not British Airways, you should be safe landing to #LHR without terrorizing plane mates ;-)) #indyref

Wow, it's seriously close in the #indyref - too close!

There's a bawhair in it, it's all up for grabs. #indyref

Hmph! Renfrewshire. We're closing in. We just need some big wins. Just a 2% difference. #indyref

Has any location voted yes? #indyref all in seeing is no declarations Surley somewhere had a yes outcome

Dundee first local authority to vote Yes. I knew things would start to look different once the larger constituencies came in #indyref

I'm sure the UK wouldn't mind conceding. The Republic of Dundee. Not quite the same ring as the Republic of Venice, but oh well #indyref

Dundee. First big area in pushes it to nearly 50/50 overall. 6000 votes in it. #IndyRef

That would be Dundee which has benefitted from extra EU regional funding because they are so rich. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

if we can secure another couple of big cities, we might actually do this #voteyes #indyref

Reaction in no camp Glasgow as Renfrewshire declares for No #indyref

To be fair, at this current moment, there's only 6,000 in it. Still possible.. #indyref

Awww c'mon Dundee I was about to sleep till you made it interesting again #indyref #Yes

Dundee - Yes 57.3% - change on 2011 SNP % vote +2.6 - results at  #indyref

Ooooooo things just got interesting #indyref

Oh, Inverclyde! You just tossed a coin and went to the pub, didn't you? #indyref

So with #Dundee declaring a #YES vote in the #indyref brings the margin of NO to less than 6,000 votes.7/32 areas declared.

#YES Dundee.. YES ! brought it back for the good guys ! #indyref

Dundee gives the night some spice. #indyref

Thanks, Dundee, youse are aw legends #indyref

So far No on 50.9pc - Yes 49.1pc #indyref

I think we should do the decent thing and just give Dundee independence. #indyref

And suddenly the national vote looks very close indeed. YES 49.1% NO 50.9%. Only 6000 votes between the UK and Independence. #indyref

Dundee, what have you done?! #indyref #bettertogether #godsavetheunion

Glued to #indyref coverage here. Dundee just made things interesting

Dundee, ya beauty.  Game on.Current totals; Yes 49.1%, No 50.9%#indyref #indyrefallnighter

It's like watching an NFL game but with countries instead of teams and percents instead of points! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#indyref,people of Dundee I am so proud of you,we vote YES!!!

So I thought #indyref was about Not so.

I want a live webcam of David Cameron watching the results in Scotland #indyref

The Yes campaign has something to cheer about. #indyref #ScotlandDecides #UK

Dundee Yes 57:43. For the record, Dundee voted 76:24 to a Parliament in 1997, only slightly more than the national average #indyref

Finally a Yes vote in Dundee. A good call for more powers away from Westminster  #indyref

Struggling now but can't go to bed knowing it's so close now #indyref

big win for YES in dundee  (as expected) , biggest region far , 6 of 32 districts , no lead cut to 51-49  IT'S ON #indyref

CARA News: RENFREWSHIRE: YES; 55466 (47.2%) NO: 62,067 (52.8%%#indyref

it's neck to neck, so close. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I'll never say a bad word about Dundee ever again #indyref #VoteYesScotland

if I'm on the Yes side, I say (win or lose) that the job for Scotland is to build a better Scotland for all #indyref #DevoMax

Staying up absolutely gripped by the #indyref -fair play to the Scots (all of them) for being so engaged in politics full stop - incredible

Groundskeeper Willie of 'The Simpsons' addresses fellow Scots ahead of vote  #indyref

Kay Burley getting shot down by Nicola Sturgeon on the BBC camera there. hahaha #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Dundee just made this vote interesting again! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

7 of 32 councils in Scotland have declared and #indyref is getting pretty close!

I hope that the journo being subjected to coverage is being paid handsomely. Legally torture, no? #indyref

It's close. Long night. MT Scotland's #indyref totals after 7 of 32 declarations:Yes 172,426 (49.1%)No 178,811 (50.9%)

Well done Dundee you have did us proud!!! #indyref

hell, it's at 50.9% no, 49.1% yes. Good cake, shite football + *weather*.  #indyref

Glad to see #YesScotland still have #FalseHope; hopefully a long, drawn-out defeat will further embitter inevitable #SourGrapes #indyref

Dundee have DRASTICALLY turned that around. #indyref

big storm woke me up now #indyref will keep me awake

FlightRadar shows a plane (Salmond's?) leaving Aberdeen at 3.05am and then disappearing(?) 14 minutes later  #indyref

First bright moment of the night: Dundee, where I grew up, becomes the 1st Council to vote for independence:YES: 57.3%NO: 42.7% #indyref

Just for one night, from a St Johnstone fan, we love Dundee, we love Dundee #indyref

If this is a trend for the big towns/cities (bar Edinburgh) we might just nick it#indyref

My #indyref tweets are being RTed by people tweeting in Tamil, living in Canada. Love the curly script!

#indyref . Keep those quips coming, very amusing

I want the BBC to cut to party again #indyref

*hugs* whatever the morning brings, let's all work together to make this island a fairer place, whether 2 nations or 1 #indyref

Dundee closed the gap dramatically but not by as much as I would have liked, still worried #indyref #YesScotland

Awesome that Dundee is independent now, our first move should be to invade Aberdeen for their oil. #indyref

These percentages are tighter than my arsehole at this current moment in time. #indyref

tears in my eyes again after Dundee brings Yes up to 49.09% so far - hope, please don't fail me #indyref

#indyref Dundee you NEVER let US down ! Brought a lump to my throat, love YOU !

Is this the start of the swing away from No? I hope not! #indyref

6th result- yes57% no43%                  7th result- yes49.1% no50.9% #indyref

Should be proud of Dundee although the vote should have been higher than 57% #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Ahhhhhh just realized what #indyref stood for

Scotland Deicides: After an unfortunate legally binding typo Scotland votes to kill God by 2016. Years changed to 90,000 days long. #indyref

Dundee City is the first district to vote YES, with 57% voting for independence #indyref

Just when I started to fear that this historic vote on #Scotland's future was going to be crap TV, Dundee makes it interesting. #indyref

Peanut butter sandwich getting me through #indyrefallnighter #indyref Starting to get interesting!

Thank you Scotland!  You've protected the prestige and prosperity of the Union. Your confidence will hopefully be justly rewarded! #indyref

BBC so random person you've been to Scotland you'll do as an expert! #indyref

I should sleep but I keep checking #indyref

on yerself Dundee! knew those teenage years in the reading rooms weren't wasted #indyref

If we lose, I'm getting yes logo tattoo as a reminder never to have faith in the intelligence and courage of the common man. #indyref

Sixth area in Scottish #indyref declares: Renfrewshire 52.8% for NO. See

Democracy at work. It's a beautiful thing. #IndyRef

Muppet politicians still framing it as SNP vs Labour #indyref

Dundee aye!  Come on Scotland!  #indyref  # scotlanddecides #VoteYes

Scotland #IndyRef - result for Dundee (2.8% of registered voters):Yes 57.3%No 42.7%

fuck - it's so close right now - yes 49.1% No 50.9% #indyref

The Scottish #indyref is some pretty exciting politics. Hoping for a Yes vote but it's not looking good so far.

The Dundee result seems to have boosted the spirits of the Yes camp that are still here waiting for the result in Kilmarnock. #indyref

Delays with DG result - expected around 4.20am now #jpScotRef #indyref

Honestly, when the Dundee result came through it felt like Scotland had scored in a World Cup final #indyref

Difference of 86 votesInverclyde votes NO in Scotland's #indyref:  Yes 27,243 (49.9%) No 27,329 (50.1%) Turnout 87.4% via

Have no fear, Andrew Marr, I'm watching til the bitter end! #IndyRef #AllToPlayFor

This vote is so close defo not going to bed lol #indyref

Important to remember Yes still at 49% of declared votes - not a rout - yet #indyref

I'm tired  I've got to work but I really wanna see the results of #indyref . I could wake up tomorrow  Scotland be it's own country.

#indyref I take back every bad thing I ever sed about Dundee! I sed alto!

I have to be up and on a bus in a few hours, and I still have twenty-five rubbish Eurovision #indyref jokes to make.

Could teen voters sway the #indyref outcome? Interesting that 16 and 17  year olds are allowed to vote.  via

The European Green Party should kick the SNP out of their European Parliament group for wasting all that paper on ballots. #indyref

This lovely #indyref map fm is starting to come together. Worth staying up all night for

Remarkable that there are no exit polls for the Scotland independence referendum. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Salmond lands in edinburgh. Does he know something we don't here? #indyref

do you mind arriving in messy house? I was going to tidy up, but going to be up all night, I think #daysleeping #indyref

Counting officer at #dumgalcount has just announced he's sharing #indyref results with central count in Edinburgh.  We'll have result soon.

Love the way Johann Lamont keeps getting interrupted by declarations. #indyref

W Dunbanshire 87.9 % turnout Yes wins #indyref

First two yes results. Moving forward is going to require delicacy  balance whatever the result, I pray for tolerance #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref East Lothian expected to declare shortly

West Dunbartonshire says Yes to independence #indyref

I will never forget the brave people like Dundee and never forgive the self interest that betrayed our nation #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

Excited to be watching the #indyref results live - Hoping for a #NoScotland

WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE VOTES YES: Right, I might take that projection back then. #indyref

So #WestDunbartonshire has declared #VoteYes 33,720 #VoteNo 28,776 Another #VoteYesScotland win in the #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Nicola Sturgeon has clearly never clapped her hands before. #indyref

Well done my home area of West Dunbartonshire #indyref

With #indyref ballots being counted, the most-viewed story is about a blacksmith taking on Hydro-Qc

OMG this is getting nail-biting! W Dunbartonshire have voted Yes #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

I feel sick watching all of this. #indyref

I was so close to falling asleep but now wide awake eeeekkkk it's soooo so close #indyref

Real democracy underway in Scotland and not a drop of blood lost or  bomb dropped or ground troops sent in.  #indyref #VoteYesScotland

Well that result from West Dunbartonshire has certainly got me awake - thanks lads and lassies. #indyref

yeah I expected turnout to be a good chunk higher and the yes vote to be a bit higher (Dundee). So I'm very sad clown atm #indyref

on night shift and blasting flower of scotland and brave heart dance remixes. cmon scotland! yasssss. #indyref #proud #yesyesyes

Yes for West Dunbartonshire - close result #indyref

Second Yes of the evening, from West Dunbartonshire. #indyref

Another #Yes, this time #WestDunbartonshire. Nip and tuck all the way, however #indyref #ScotlandDecides #Scotland

Apparently West Dunbartonshire going Yes is not so unexpected as the Credit Suisse map would suggest  #indyref

West Dunbartonshire: Yes 53.6% No: 46.04% from a turnout of 87.9% #indyref

Stand up and shout! West Dunbartonshire, I LOVE YOU! #voteyes #indyref #scotdecides

West Dunbartonshire just made me proud! Well done, dad! #indyref

Jumping about going mental forgetting its 4 in the morning #indyref

Such a high turnout! Whatever happens, well-fucking-done Scotland.#indyref #UseYourVote

Interesting one from West Dunbartonshire. A boost for Yes, but my last tweet about border areas still not declared worth noting #indyref

Really want to stay up and watch this but I have a course tomorrow morning at 8 #indyref

0.4% lead for No. We can still do this Scotland! #indyref

Why do all the yes voters need to wait for the second number to start cheering.. can they not subtract the yes votes from the total #indyref

As the grandson of a Rentonian absolutely delighted and proud of West Dumbartonshire! #indyref

If that's right would be largest No vote in #indyref so far.  #dumgalcount

For reference, compare Scotland's #indyref question in that last

wooohooo! Well she wear them to school tomorrow as well. She totally should! #IndyRef #indyrefallnighter

That puts YES only 1500 votes behind. #indyref

Curious to see some of the rejected ballots.  #Scotland #indyref

Don't think this could be any tighter! #indyref

The BBC seems really confused by simple arithmetic right now #ScotlandDecides #indyref

For once it pays to be in the US during a Brit event. They're all tired and I'm raring to go. Bring on more declarations! #indyref

#IndyRef Now less than 1 per cent between the brave and the slaves.

Storms over North London now stopped but Dundee+West Dunbartonshire results in #indyref means more turbulence and now will remain up longer

large county Dundee in Scotland has voted  the results have come in: resounding yes for Independence. Narrows things considerably #indyref

Indiana, we are just passing though history. This, this IS history #indyref

Has prematurely/incorrectly called the #indyref yet

I really hope that scotland doesn't let this opportunity fall. #indyref #scotland

Just when I thought it was safe to go to bed the result is 50/50. Come on the no's #indyref

Oh ya hoor sir! I was about to turn over and go to sleep! Well done West Dunbartonshire #IndyRef

West Dunbartonshire says Yes - 54% vs 46% #indyref #jpScotRef
