#indyref The good Prof was probably right on - he went on to take a 1st but in English. He, too, can write.

#indyref Anyone thought about the fact what PM offered wasnt the deal. Deal was just for Scots not 2 inc Eng!

Scottish Independence Referendum.

Currently posting letters to Scottish MPs asking them not to vote on English only issues in Westminster #indyref

But still, he didn't have the power to sell anything else and what he did do was really good. #indyref was exactly what the Uk needed.

The obligatory 'don't mourn, organise' post for #indyref from Edinburgh AF is pretty good.

VIDEO: Alex Salmond, leader of Scottish independence push, concedes. #indyref #Bettertogether

wouldn't waste time with agenda driven journo's. Huff ran article yestdy suggesting #indyref Blair's fault

No great fan of Salmond, but anyone who ranted and raved about him or voted No because of him/the SNP, you have your wish. #indyref

You 16-17 year olds; really did your country proud. 73% of you for Yes. Bodes well for the next stronger wave of campaigners.#indyref

Congratulations to the 73% of pensioners over 65 to 70 who have screwed over every 17-18 year olds chance for a free education. #indyref

So seeing she helped sell the idea to the Scots will now resign over Milliband's refusal to accept Brown's timetable? #indyref

No so sure about this. Brown, and his impact on #indyref could well linger like Banquo's ghost whenever Miliband pops up.

Same as the #torylabour threatening promisesthey created chaos and division and rule with disorder #indyref

Hope all the Celtic supporting #NoVoters will be out congratulating the #OrangeOrder for their support in the #IndyRef today.

Was so looking forward to opening up a new export market but sadly it won't be the case! #indyref

Am sure votes cast done on best reasons and evidence, which people can disagree over; not afraid or anti anything, different views. #IndyRef

A UK that remains intact is a more secure  nation in the face of extreme politics on the continent. 2/3 #indyref

Scottish referendum: KEY RESULTS, while Yes wins in only four of 32 areas - Belfast Newsletter  #indyref

Alex #Salmond resigning? Gosh! Why now?I just don't get it.#IndyRef's first casualty. Surely not its last.

Whereas YES Scotland was a democratic movement quarantined from England, maybe we'll set more than the heather on fire. #devomax #indyref

I trust that plans for the Glaswegian independence campaign are now well underway? #indyref #glasgow

Tensions rising in Glasgow #indyref Police at the scene in George Square

Scotlands shame!  #Nothanks I wonder what theyd have done if theyd lost! #indyref

The Union as we know it is dead, says Welsh First Minister - Belfast Newsletter  #indyref

thing I learned from #indyref - for many Americans the word 'independence' makes them as excited as 'freedom' or 'justice' without context

Spanish, French, Italians and Belgians all deny they have talked to Salmond about  Scotland's EU membership.

Has Westminster written cheques for Scotland it cannot afford to cash? #indyref

Quebec separatists mocked relentlessly amid #Scotland vote #indyref  via

#Glasgow: Nazi salutes from the #No side at #GeorgeSquare.#indyref #Scotlandvia

#IndyRef: It would be ironic if #England campaigns/votes for an English social democratic parliament.

I'd like to thank David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne for securing this #No vote. Not. #indyref

The Queen parses the #indyref result. It almost seems She was reconciled to a Scotland in the Commonwealth

#indyref stand down.the eyes of the world are back on kim kardishan's arse.
