Superbowl Patriots vs Giants.

If the Giants get the run game going, the Pats are going to be in a world of shit. #SuperBowl

Love Miranda's mic! And damn, Blake Shelton is so hot! Oh, they sound good too. #superbowl

You know, w/o all these expensive commercials, it would never occur to people to drink beer. #SuperBowl

Who should I be wanting to win this #superbowl thing? Will be easier to enjoy if I want someone to actually win!

The only thing I hate about the #SuperBowl ? Not wanting to miss the commercials to let the beer out.

#SuperBowl saving breakfast all around the world..my hero ^__^
