Obama, Romney rush to the finish with battleground state stops

Even if your state *won't* go for Obama (e.g., this state), you still must vote. Don't think your vote doesn't matter.

it IS another case of lesser of two evils, but Romney is MUCH less evil than Obama, ya know?

They clowned obama for having hov and bruce but mitt has Meatloaf and Kid Rock and thats ok? im crying

I agree Christie had to get $ for NJ, but he didn't have to pander. A MR win means Obama couldn't short funding btwn now  Jan.

You know how many old Black folks will be praying for Obama later? If you need something, better ask God now.

Farting in an envelope and mailing it to Mitt Romney.

My debate on Romney's 5-Point Plan appears 11/1/12 on WMBF NBC News Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Raycom News Network!

This American Jew broad can't comprehend another MOT voting for Romney.

President Obama is the real deal--a claim that could never be made about Romney no matter how much one tries.

My #Christian friends, if Obama re-elected, we'll loose r religious freedom to worship God. WHAT WOULD #JESUS DO? Would he vote for #Obama?

Obama can blame it on the toxic legacy of the economy, Romney on the damage done to the Republican brand.

It CAN'T be that close with Indies breaking for Romney like they say they are unless people are lying to pollsters.

my view this is to important for a side issue, Obama the lesser of two evils,Romney? warmonger

If time for the awesome Obama ground game to go into effect.

NPR calls Virginia for Obama, bringing him to a projected 303 electoral votes vs. 203 for Romney.

Alright Obama all you gotta do now is deal with a republican house. A brother is tryna stay on his moms healthcare for 6 more yrs son

Yep. Neither Romney or the TeaParty failed here. A clear choice was on the ballot. America chose to run away from its problem.

Troops should all retire.  Obama can send his voters to manage Afghanistan  his Arab Spring.  They'd do anything 4 him, right?

Fairly certain Romney would not have played a Nu Schooz track had he won

To all the kids at LPPACS who keep talking shit on Romney - just remember hes the one who supports the charter schools like LP, not Obama.
