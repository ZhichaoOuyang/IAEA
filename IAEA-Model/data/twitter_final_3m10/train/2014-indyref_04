Summer is icumen in/ Loudly sing Cuckoo/ Grows the seed and blows the mead/ And springs the wood anew #indyref

Every time I hear people cheering a No vote I feel physically ill. When we get a Tory/UKIP coalition you fucking remember tonight. #indyref

in DC watching the #indyref, definitely not completely shitfaced

Alex Salmond now 3/1 to resign as First Minister before end of the week. (Paddy Power) #indyref

Yes Jeremy, let's find out what the poor people are doing. #indyref

45,542 votes between Yes and No. No leading 53% to 47%. Glasgow would need to deliver like a 10% difference to cancel that out. #indyref

East Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire, and Fife expected soon. #indyref

Goodnight Twitter - Love you, and #Scotland too. #indyref

I know it's pretty earlier to call, but my gut says No wins the #indyref cc #RefTV Hoping I'm wrong. Will probably be close, though!

ooh, Dumfries and Galloway goes No in a big way. #indyref

Sad fish.  First photo of Alex Salmond as Scotland's #indyref declarations continue

Total votes are Yes: 407,140 and No: 496,256. 14 votes have been declared. #ntfm #indyref

Labour members apparently dancing about celebrating with Tories, makes you sick. You sellout, pathetic wankers #indyref

Sorry YES, Steiner's army isn't coming. #indyref

No is going to take it by a wider margin than predicted.  I am going to get some sleep; Scarborough Toyota awaits me at 07:00. #IndyRef

We're roughly halfway through #IndyRef results. Everyone get up from their chairs and do a quick stretch

It's OK for me if Scotland is going to stay in the Union but it's better if they will be independent :( =) #indyref #VoteYes

Angus - Yes 43.7% - change on 2011 SNP % vote -10.4 - results at  #indyref

Glaswegian definitely a top-10 proper name. #indyref

Scotland #indyref: NO leads 56% to 44% with 17 out of 32 councils declared - but less than a third of the vote counted.

Glasgow may be declaring in next 10 minutes. That'll pretty much nail it #indyref

Glasgow to vote yes according to Sky.  #indyref

Said I'd not watch the election results. Woken up and felt compelled to. It's too important. Although won't last the night #indyref

A rare win for YES in North Lanarkshire, but 51-49% margin makes only a minor dent into the huge NO lead. #indyref

To me tonight isn't about independance, it's about giving people a choice to decide their future #indyref

#indyref Yes:No ratio remains about the same, but margin of votes widens #RefTV

Perth  Kinross YES 40% NO 60%..Astonishing result in SNP heartland #indyref

Hi hipster dude with turban and sunglasses. #indyref

Scotland, you had one job #indyref #voteyes

90% turnout. Jesus. The straight-up popular vote is wonderful. #indyref #Scotland

That's it - No wins #indyref. Less than 50% of votes to go, Yes would need 57% of all remaining votes. Won't happen.

Cue for all geniuses on $TWTR who called #IndyRef down to the percentage point to start congratulating themselves in three.two.one.

So many 'could it happen here' columns being furiously edited and hopefully deleted right now. #indyref

How do we get #indyref turnouts in our elections? I have democracy envy. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

Must commend the  online streaming, anchor, rountables,  interviews throughtout the night #indyref

Keep up with the Scottish Risky vote here:  #indyref

Really wish people wouldn't dump on the queen ~ She was pretty ambivalent about it ~ Don't think it really mattered ~ #indyref

We had some no votes on our independence referendum too #indyref

#Scotland needs to change, 46% can't be wrong, give people water  they will drink it, give people a voice and they will speak #indyref

From what I hear, and if it;s truthful, thank you Scotland. Thank you #indyref

What should join John Reid for? Not what he wants. He wants to stitch YES Scotland up. We have a different agenda. #indyref

The takeaway: Independence isn't for everybody. Poor buggers. #IndyRef

Politicians on all sides doing their best to sound humble   conciliatory following vote.  This is progress #indyref #democracy

Don't worry, #Scotland - there's always next time. But thank you for kicking Westminster in the complacency. They needed it. #IndyRef

David Cameron succeeded in convincing Scotland to vote for 100% of income tax. That's the bottom line for the NO vote. #indyref #Scotland

I can't think of anyone LESS relevant to the #indyref than Nigel Farage, #BBC. Except Kaiser Wilhelm II, perhaps. But he's dead. STOP IT.

At least there's one thing that's new: Eddie Izzard has finally been involved in a campaign that didn't end in utter humiliation. #indyref
