Just punt, Giants. Your punter is having the game of his life. Don't be selfish. TEAMWORK makes the DREAM WORK. #Superbowl

Only reason I'm cheering for the Giants is because I don't want anyone tied with the Steelers.  team #blackandgold everyday #SuperBowl

The #superbowl commercial for awake reminds me of my life. Wishing this was just a bad dream I could wake from.

Wish I was watching #superbowl But nah I'm out on these cold roads grinding..

GoDaddy ads are as sexy as discarded toner cartridges #SuperBowl

As long as Billy Cundiff isn't the Giants kicker, they should be able to win this game. #SuperBowl

Come on Myra!  Send us some love #MHK #Patriots #superbowl

Mom's telling me to calm down. Can't. Too close. Too stressful. #SuperBowl

I'm basically inhaling beers at this point, just glad I don't smoke anymore. #superbowl

I'll be streaming after the #SuperBowl.  Let's have our own post-game party!

Surely the game is overGiants can't loseCan they? #SuperBowl

The #SuperBowl is more American than the 4th of July.

Thoughts on the #SuperBowl? TEAM SHERLOCK/WATSON FTW!!! #lol #StupidBowl

Will We see another Scott Norwood? #SuperBowl

This postseason the Giants always manage to find a way to win. They are true champions. #superbowl

Any big surprise unveiled in the #SuperBowl ads already? The best & the big disappointments as yet?

stop salsa dancing pats, let's go giants! Run that ball! #SuperBowl

Stop them stop them stop them #superbowl #GoPats

Starts with a safety.. Ends with a missed FG? #superbowl .. I think it'd be cool..

One great catch does not mean you had a great 4th quarter. #superbowl

Patriots go be salty as hell after this #SuperBowl

Yes, #Eli is an Elite QB in the #NFL. He has arrived. Wow, what a drive in the #Superbowl #Giants #Pats #Manning #classact

Hey, homies! This has been fun! #SuperBowl

I imagine Madonna was under dressed and over muscled as usual. Probably miming. Probably terrible #superbowl

Ok im done pretending like I care about the #SuperBowl

2nd #superbowl #sbad badlanded - we've seen that fetching dog thing before. For Bud light. In the superbowl.

It's coming down to the wire. Check out the #SuperBowl commercial live blog before it's over!

looks like its giants to lose now!! #nfl #superbowl

This has been a pretty good #SuperBowl. The punting has been lights-out, and offenses both have saved themselves for two-minute drills.

I can't even handle the #superbowl right now.

Ok, almost giving up, *yawn* *sleep*, I just have to see the end of this game #superbowl.

Only Reason I'm Goin' For The Giants Is Cuz My Neighbor Use To Play For Em ! #SuperBowl

I didn't care who won earlier in week but giants talked so much I wanted then to Lose but looks like they were right. #SuperBowl

That's what's effing up GIANTS!!!!!! #superbowl

It's Brady time!!! Belichick is a genius! #SuperBowl

Regardless of the result I've enjoyed this unbelievably. Big plays, mistakes, big hits, tension. Quality. #superbowl

That touchdown looked like my last trip to the bathroom.  #superbowl

Just get in Ahmad Bradshaw. Yes, Patriots let you score, but just get in. If you're meant to win the SB, the defense will win it. #Superbowl

okay that was weird. shouldn't that be considered a technical for showing off? #SuperBowl

Whoa I didnt see that coming #superbowl

Haha.. They let him go. Awesome #superbowl

I did. I swear the #SuperBowl is overrated. I just wana know who wins. I don't give a shit abt EVERY detail of it like some people do

DUDE  THAT PLAY WAS PURE AWESOMENESS  TOUCHDOWN ! #GIANTS #SuperBowl

Well *now* the last minute is *really* interesting #superbowl

Haha the Giants assed their way into a touchdown #SuperBowl #Giants

That was the best touchdown play ever! Hahahah #giants #superbowl

Ahmad Bradshaw trying to decide to score or not too made the game. #SuperBowl

PETA's #SuperBowl ads that were too hot for TV

Very funny. Cue awkward laugh! Is Manning the kosher version of Manningham? #SuperBowl

Never was a time when I DIDN'T want to see a touchdown!!! SMH!!! #SuperBowl #nyg #gmen #giants #ALLIN

Fuc the#superbowl I aint payn shit pussys

How dare this game have a normal-looking score line now. #SuperBowl

I am actually scared to be on twitter right now. #superbowl

That could have been a fatal mistake falling in the end zone #SuperBowl

Wow too much time on the clock noooo!! #SuperBowl #Giants

Fuck Yes Knew You Could Do It Giants#SuperBowl

Coudn't have made that #touchdown any better #giants #superbowl

Was that the first backwards TD in #SuperBowl history? Also #wha?

Can the Patriots please score just one point right now so I can win some money on the #SuperBowl pot? No? Damn.

Not cheering for a team at this point just the clock - #superbowl

Damn he sat down on them! #SuperBowl

Let's go #Giants !! #SuperBowl .. I have to cheer for the Manning! :)

The Patriots thought it was over!! They got another thing coming!#superbowl

Woooo. TD. Just, nearly took a knee on the one. Should've. Failed on the 2 point convo. 21-17 Giants. 57 sec left. Time for Tom. #SuperBowl

Stop trending #SuperBowl and START TRENDING #SOSHoms. #Homs is under attack for the third night in a row. #Syria Thank you #Russia & #China

Wow, I've never seen anything like that before what a crazy end to this game.  #SuperBowl

Gotta love the sit down touch down!! #superbowl

GIANTS WIN! GIANTS WIN! GIANTS WIN! GIANTS WIN! GIANTS WIN! GIANTS WIN! #superbowl #NY #giants

Thats fuckin great strategy by the patriots #superbowl

#Patriots didn't even try to get off their blocks. Bradshaw wanted his #SuperBowl shine

Greatest touchdown ever. Even the refs and defense were chuckling. #Superbowl

the patriots just let the giants get a touchdown in order to have more time?? #superbowl #amazing

Awesome TD by Bradshaw!!  Boneheaded move by Coughlin going for two.  but whatever. We're up by 4.  Let's go D! #superbowl #NYG #Giants

YES BABY WE WON AND TAKING THE GOLD BACK HOME! #SuperBowl #NYGIANTS 3

You are a PROFESSIONAL athlete you lack the ability to stop and fall down? haha #SuperBowl

These guys better hurry up. Mythbusters is on soon #SuperBowl

If the #Giants didnt want to score. Why not sneak or kneel it? #SuperBowl

Come on giants, 57 seconds left! Keep it together! #SuperBowl

WOW! #SuperBowl night reaches 18K followers! Let's get him to 20K! :D

Patriots just let the Giants score, extremely gutsy call #SuperBowl

I would be standing if I wasn't on my laptopomg.#brandbowl #superbowl

Absolutely amazing touchdown right there. Nowrun that clock down! #touchdowngiants #superbowl

Come on Brady. Come on Patriots. Still believe. #superbowl

This next drive could kill me, come on Giants! #Superbowl

Patriots NEED a touchdown. One timeout left. THIS IS HISTORY. (And the epic NFL theme conveniently plays) #SuperBowl

WHAT THE FRESH PRINCE!? He sat his way to victory! #superbowl #plymouth2012 #nonchalanttouchdown

OMG I'm so butch right now screaming b/c the giants made a touchdown! #Superbowl

Haha, I like how that guy just sat his ass down in the end zone. #SuperBowl

Most strange touchdown ever! Opponent was on his way back to knock him over the line! #goodstrategy #Superbowl

#dear tom brady: folks is fearing you right now. #superbowl

Touch down or sit down? Never have seen one of those! #SuperBowl #SB46

Damnnnn everyone was thinking that's the move, but only the homeless Bill Belichick would actually do it #Superbowl

In going back to my call . . Long ball . . Ochocinco . . game-winning TD #SuperBowl

A big last minute for the Patriots. Nail biter. #superbowl

What kinda bitch sits down in the inzone #bottombitch #superbowl #gayswatchingthesuperbowl

Gutsy call by the Patriots there. Playing like they have an XBox 360 controller in hand. Love the competitiveness though. #SuperBowl #SB46

I think the Leafs are going to win the #Superbowl

#ThatAwkwardMomentWhen you try not to score a touchdown but you fall into the end zone   #SuperBowl

Tom Brady's chance to prove he is the greatest quarterback of all time! #SuperBowl #gopats

So which one of these guys is Kim Kardashian boning these days? A bunch of them you say? All of them? Who gives a f  #SuperBowl

80 yards in 50 seconds. only brady is capable but i hope it doesn't happen #superbowl

Fire alarm going off, but I refuse to leave till I see the last minute of the #superbowl

Either way, this is a pretty classic #SuperBowl. Great game.

If the #Patriots pull this our #Belichick will have made one hell of a play call giving up a free touchdown only in the #nfl #superbowl WOW!

Good mornin tweeps :) #SuperBowl is in full swing i guess but never watched it so rest of keep at it lol

I would feel so much pressure stepping on with 57 seconds left #TomBrady #SuperBowl

Massive finish in the #superbowl.. 57seconds left on the clock..

Ahmad bradshaw best touchdown ever? #superbowl #nbc

wow this is intense possibly one of the weirdest touchdowns i have seen #superbowl

I think that was dumb to let them score. #superbowl

I'm about to pull a Tebow and burst into tears if the Patriots lose. #superbowl #comeonpats #Brady

My team isn't even on the game and I'm still nervous #superbowl

Brady is hot. thats all im qualified to add about this game. #Superbowl

Has there ever been a coach with a Gatorade allergy?  #SuperBowl

even though its not the packers this is still so cool!! #superbowl

Hold 'Em Giants!! Hold 'Em!! #SUPERBOWL

Is this Chad 85 guy related to Johnny 5? Cause that would be awesome. #SuperBowl

Okay, I better turn on the TV -- those were NYers in my building screaming #superbowl

80 yards in 57 seconds. Can Pats do it? #Superbowl

Things that are impossible: getting your boyfriend to board a plane in the last 10 mins of the #SuperBowl  #Pats

Brady trying his heart out. Wide Receivers letting him down. #Superbowl

Pats take the fieldcue the Imperial March! ---__--- #GoGiants #BeatThePats #Superbowl

Why cant the patriots just go ahead and score so i can work on my homework #superbowl

Ochocinco will score the game winning Touchdown! #SuperBowl

#superbowl boils down to 57 seconds - forget making the most out of every minute - how about every second!

Um, did Bradshaw just pop a squat into the end zone!?! That's just way too much awesomeness!!! #takeaseatPatriots #SuperBowl

That halftime performance by madonna..was so..blaah Still not memorable ala Justin and Janet jackson :P #superbowl

If Hollywood has taught me anything, it is that 57 secs in the final quarter is enough to make miracles happen #englishmanabroad #Superbowl

Come on Pats I don't wanna wear my shirt backwards tomorrow #SuperBowl

Witty play by bradshaw not gonna lie #poppedasquat #superbowl

would rather hear do commentary for this game than the goons doing it right now #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl ads C-. Maybe next year. #sodisappointed

Popo are out & checkpoints are everywhere! Everyone be safe & don't drive drunk!!! #SuperBowl #Vegas

How can you NOT want a touchdown to take the lead with under a minute to go??!! #SB46 #superbowl

fine I'll say it: good job Bradshaw. Its the  #Superbowl score that TD. Have some faith in your Defense.

Did I miss the Red Carpet PreShow? #Superbowl

Haha you can't catch in pressure #Giants #SuperBowl #likealways

LOL Still won in the pool in the last quarter. Thank you failed two point conversion. THANK YOU. #superbowl #giants

#SuperBowl Brady still goes down for the best QB to play da bowl n a minute unless u can get Newton or Breeze n it

A chef friend set up a NY vs New England buffet of steak (and buffalo wings) vs oysters (and lobster rolls). #Superbowl #food

Ahhhhhh I wanna cry! This is too intense. #superbowl

We got this. We got this. We got this. We got this. #LetsgoGiants #SuperBowl

COME ON GIANTS KEEP THIS UP AND BRADY KEEP FUCKING UP #SUPERBOWL

Could have been MVP BY NOT SCORING THE TD! Now I have seen everything! #SuperBowl

If I'm ever in the Super Bowl I'mGonna make sure I turn around and sit on my ass for every touchdown. That's a promise. #superbowl

Omg!!!!! 37secs! Come on giants hold on to it!! #superbowl

Pitbull style!!!! Coquelin will be good at #Superbowl haha

Marvel does it again. Avengers is superhero action packed and sure to be a box office hit #superbowl

Once again.FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #SuperBowl COME ON NOW PATRIOTS!!!! WTF!!!!!!!

This is starting to remind me of the last time the #Giants and #Patriots faced off in the #SuperBowl.

NE about to lose, WR to be blamed for that. #Superbowl

This is why I love NFL!!! 1 more stop!! #SuperBowl #nyg

Its lookin like a #Giant #SuperBowl folks  here we go

#Superbowl #TomBrady Bellicheat - New England can't win (again) without cheating - bring on the *astrisk!

Watching the #SuperBowl is more stressful than dealing with any relationship problems

These #PATRIOTS running backs are throwing this game away! Why aren't they catching!! #SUPERBOWL

Worst touchdown in #Giants history?  Very well could be #SUPERBOWL

I never thought my mom was SO into football!!! #Superbowl

#Giants have won this game, no coming back from the #Patriots #SuperBowl #SB46

I think I'll make a prediction on who will win the Super Bowl now.  The Giants by 4. #superbowl

No idea what's happening but I'm on the edge of my seat! #SuperBowl #MadonnaBowl

Sssssssssssssssaaaaack! 4th down, no time outs, 80 yds to go! #superbowl

Lucas oil is going insane right now #indy #superbowl

Los Patriots en 4th and Forever #SuperBowl #Giants

This has been the best Superbowl I've seen in awhile! Plus my boy is handing out the Lombardi #sb46 #Booyah

It's a shame how I'm home..all alonein bedwith this bowl of strawberries & whipped cream #SuperBowl #WhatsMissing

My girlfriend let me score back in '87. And I will always be grateful. #SuperBowl

Lots of yelling coming from the man cave. Jeebus, isn't it over yet? #superbowl

Not over yet! First down and out of bounds  #superbowl

oh God, #NE got first down #superbowl #NYG

#jayleno stole Jerry's #acura #nsx like it was Conan O'Brien's talk show. #superbowl

OMG this game is so close! Did u see that last homerun?? #SuperBowl

It wouldnt be normal if my uncle didnt break a glass bottle and say every curse word in the book a millian times #SuperBowl

I swore to myself I wasn't gonna tweet AT ALL during the #SuperBowl but this last 1:40 has been NERVE WRACKING!!

I never enjoy seeing Brandon Jacobs happy. Celebrating is even worse. #SuperBowl

He SAT into the game-changing touchdown and the Pats started getting butterfingers #superbowl

THIS IS INCREDIBLE! Game over one minute, next it is alive #SB46 #SuperBowl

Tom Brady just got introduced to the new TUCK rule!!! #superbowl

Madonna was awesome at Superbowl, but not as good as Black Eyed Peas last year. #SuperBowl

At the last down  This is a whirlpool  On yo daughtas face #SuperBowl #football

you should be so proud of me Watching the #Superbowl !!!

Omg is anyone else seeing this? Who knew football could be so whatever! Go sports team! #superbowl

Tom Brady that niggathis game is not over #SuperBowl

Just lost half of my #Superbowl party to #DowntonAbbey. #howdidthathappen

He's hot!  Let's be honest: the 2nd most popular topic among gays during the #superbowl is Aaron Hernandez!

#superbowl what a game! Cant write this stuff!!! #bbcsuperbowl

Football should come with blood pressure medication cause this is INSANE #Superbowl or maybe its just me!

2 dropped passes and not one by Ochoa Cinco. Wierd #SuperBowl

Retweet if you can't take this anymore. #SuperBowl

Damn, spoke too soon. This game is too intense. #SuperBowl

Everything about that Kia commercial was great, except the fact that it was a Kia. #superbowl

Surely Brady can't pull this one off?? #superbowl

the New York Giants won so just stop da clock..#superbowl..

They're at least going to get a Hail Mary out of this . . . #SuperBowl

Yes! No ring for Chad Ochoccinco He's so annoying #Superbowl

moment of truth, guys. Pats fans, say your hail-Marys. Giants fans, here we gooooo. #SuperBowl

Oy. Whatever happens this has been a great game. So much stress in the last minute! #superbowl

Giants have too many men on the field. Damn you, world overpopulation! #superbowl #lateshowwriters

that was still the most epic touchdown in superbowl history #giants #superbowl

How do you date the hottest women in the world and not get a TD #SuperBowl #VictoriaSecret

It probably is the weirdest ever.  rt VIDEO: The weirdest touchdown in Super Bowl history  #SuperBowl

How come you can spike ball to stop clock and it's not considered intentional grounding? That's about as intentional as it gets.  #SuperBowl

Don't even watch football, but this is exciting to watch! #SuperBowl

Do they not know how to fuckin' count or something?! #superbowl

who needs a tv when you have twitter to give you a play by play #superbowl

I think I'm  one of the few who's not actually watching the #Superbowl. LOL!

I'm taking the Tebow posePlease let New England win.#superbowl

Marketing at half time #superbowl is out of this world, beats fifa world cup and olympics marketing put together WOWWWZA

Mental lapses, clock management. Brilliant #superbowl

Now that Eli has 2 #SuperBowl rings his brother will now be known as #Peyton - The other white Manning

Watching this game is really showing me how much football knowledge I have. I'm a reinvented fan of the NFL with this game alone #SuperBowl

Nine seconds man come on hell game over lol #GIANTS #superbowl #NEWYORKGIANTS #

Brady trying to make himself a hero but I think the Giants can close this out. Still should've taken the knee though. #Superbowl

One last play with 05 seconds left in the game! #SuperBowl

Would be cool to see patriots make this. #SuperBowl

Lets see what you got Brady #superbowl

Didn't watch 1 minute of the game, but just from twitter and Facebook I feel like I watched it play by play! #SuperBowl

More than half of the country is talking to their t.v's #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl  Gets exciting during the last minutes of the game lol!

Hail Mary to Ocho Cinco. Calling it. #Superbowl

I've never seen so many commercials with half naked women in a row before #superbowl

Lets wrap this up.  I've got some Maggie Smith to attend to #SuperBowl #DowntonAbbey

SUPER BOWL FINAL SCORE: Giants 21 - Patriots 17. What a terrific season for the Giants. I'm a Believer! #ALLIN #SB46 #SuperBowl #NYG

Normal hatred of Giants being trumped by joy at Belichick's indigestion-face. #superbowl

Giants win by just taking a seat in the end zone. Extra points for style number 44. #superbowl

buen super bowl  #SuperBowl sorry patriotas

A Hockey commercial during the #superbowl coverageI love it.

Well, not my usual Giants but some Giants they were, the #NYG just won the #SB46 #SuperBowl 21 - 17

Sad to see brady's #legacy held off for another year but he gave a safety and a pick Soo I don't feel too bad .. Good #superbowl

I believe that is 10 straight years a #Hawkeye has been a #Superbowl champ

I wonder who won the #superbowl ? not enough tweets about it.

who won the superbowl? who won? oh yeah GIANTS WON #superbowl TOLD YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I was really hoping Tom Brady could come up with a miracle. Would've made for a better ending. oh well, better luck next time #SuperBowl

Always nice to see rich people cheering in a luxury box. #superbowl

Eli Manning is officially cooler than his older brother.  I hate when that happens. #stupidyoungerbrothers #Giants #superbowl

If a Pat HAD caught the ball, that might've been the most amazing end to SB game ever. But glad Massachusetts has been denied.  #superbowl

Heck Yeah!!! That's what I'm talking about!!!! #SuperBowl  #Giants #FTW

Win or lose  We all need a #beer. #patriots #giants #superbowl #craftbeer

Ok, game over folks. Just call it and let's keep it moving. #Giants #SuperBowl

Have to watch that #DowntonPBS again  - too much bouncing back and forth to #superbowl

YES!!! MY BOYS THE NEW YORK GIANTS HAVE WON THE 46th #superbowl!!!! 21-17 baby!! Ha, what now mom?? (she was going for the patriots) :P

I think the best bit of the whole #superbowl was when BBC showed the guy in orange doing a flip for a touchdown.

Congratulations, NY Giants! Next time, Pats. #superbowl

#HailMary didn't work. #Manning still looks like he's surprised 2 b there at all. How could #Hoodie lose again? #GameOver #SuperBowl

Great end to the #NFL season with the #Giants winning the #SuperBowl over the #Patriots 21-17. Oh, and while you were snacking, #Duke lost!

Glad the Giants won but #SuperBowl is mad uneventful before AND after halftime. I'm still Vouging and whatnot. #TeamNBA #FB

Big Ups To The Giants Fucking Shit. Lmfao. #superbowl

Gratz to the New York Gaints!! Great game! #SuperBowl

Well thats disappointing. I'm probably the only Massachusetts resident on my timeline right now. #superbowl

I don't think I've ever been so bored by a game this close in my life. #Superbowl

Pats got their butt beat by the same team twice in the superbowl.. Bills vs cowboys or what? #superbowl

did your grandma let you watch the #SuperBowl? :) or were you there?

The Giants win the #superbowl! Paula, the Panacea octopus, was right!

Tigers beating the Jayhawks? Eli Manning a two-time Super Bowl champ? Maybe the Mayans were right #kubball #NFL #SuperBowl

people on my block screaming, please stopbut still, GIANTS! NY FTW! #SuperBowl

big ups to for her list of inappropriate #superbowl announcer comments   #WeAre12

#in dog's not better than the Vader, #Audi beats both #superbowl #SoLongVampires

Congratulations to New York. It was a fair played game but I'm sad 4 my Patriots :-( #SuperBowl

Eli Manning always gets the spotlight but tonight my heart goes out to Bradshaw. Really happy with the end result of this years #Superbowl

How does a guy with down syndrome win the #SuperBowl

I'll remember #SB46 as the SuperBowl I was sober.  Not because it was special but because I don't remember the rest.

Big blue!!! We did it again #superbowl

Top Manning status in Indianapolis, and Archie's heart has been upgraded to Eli #SuperBowl

Yay! Giants win! #superbowl   Black Squirrel

I'm slightly disappointed that the Giants won the #Superbowl. They look like regular-sized people to me. I was expecting actual giants.

Let's go Giants. Watching it with a bloke from New York made it all the better. #Eliforpresident #superbowl

And mom sent me a sms giants won #Superbowl lol

Not many moments in sport are quite as exciting as a mid flight ball flying into the end zone in the last seconds #HAILMARY #SuperBowl

Quality game. Eli over Peyton any day. Peace. #Superbowl

#Giants won!! Wooo go NY show those Patriots who da Boss #SuperBowl

Love watching the patriots lose! Congrats to Eli and the Giants! #giants #SuperBowl #patssuck

What have been your favorite 30 seconds of the #SuperBowl so far? This is ours:  #beckhamforhm

Ceecill is brilliant. What a motivator. How u like those apples!! #superbowl

I don't understand why the #SuperBowl is such a big deal. I only watch it for the commercials.

It's not where you start, it's where you finish! #superbowl

That was an awesome Super High Def game.. #EverySecondCounts #SuperBowl

I have to admit it is fun watching a nerd beat a jock. #SuperBowl

Congrats #Giants fans!  Oh, and I was right on my #SuperBowl prediction!!!  WHOOP WHOOP!

At least in football it comes down to one game not 7 #SuperBowl

If the giants have taught us anything, its that the regular season doesn't mean anything.  #superbowl

Deja-vu. Great season, tough pill to swallow #SuperBowl #GoPats

What were the best/worst commercials during the #superbowl? Take our survey!  #superbowlads

Extended #SuperBowl spot for Disney's released - coming to theaters March 9, 2012

I guess tom brady just can't beat a manning. #Giants #SuperBowl #GMEN

Didn't think the NY #Giants had a chance at the end when the #Patriots had too much time left but great game! Final score 21-17! #superbowl

as Bridget Moynahan cackles quietly to herself. #superbowl

hear that? that's the air going out of the Tom Brady/Bill Belichick balloon. life moves on. #superbowl

BREAKING: The New York Giants are the 2012 Super Bowl champions * go Giants!! #superbowl

Congratulations to the who are #SB46 champions! Great effort from Big Blue. #Giants #SuperBowl

The crappest American Football match I have EVER watched And I went to Scottish Claymore games! #SuperBowl

Well #Pats fans at least your team played in the #Superbowl. When u guys going #superbowlin #raidersnation

And like I said since Steelers went out of the playoffs.. Giants are the winners of the #SuperBowl XLVI

There you have it.  Your #SuperBowl champs lost to the #Redskins twice this year.

So today I won 53$ on #buttdown  (keyed by ) from a #SuperBowl game I didn't watch because of travel. Whatever Go #giants !

LETS TRY THIS AGAIN What a game 3 Broken BUT #MuchRespectNYG #Superbowl

Question: why was the woman speaking Portuguese in a Fiat commercial? #SuperBowl

You know who's partying right now? Rooney Mara's family. #giants #superbowl

You know the #superbowl rigged anytime they have #12men on the field with :10 left, that never happens

Congrats NYG won But #Patriots is a gr8 team And Brady is a legend#superbowl #XLVI #Patriots #Giants

Now that the #SuperBowl is done, I can now focus on #WM28.

New York Giants! WD! I'm happy:-) #bbcSuperbowl #superbowl #bedtime #winning #kerching #bbcwardrobethief

Rockin' the Super Bowl & the little black dress, Pop Star Madonna is a Timeless Classic :-)#Madonna, #teamMadonna, #superbowl

Eli, 2-0 in the #SuperBowl AGAINST the 'future Hall of Fame' Brady

Feels like I'm the only person in the world who didn't watch the #superbowl. #unilife

that had to be the funniest winning touchdown in #superbowl history. #buttdown

I just wonder how much their bodies ache after a game. Ouch! #SuperBowl

I liked the part where the big fellow in spandex fell on his butt in the end zone. mwahaha  #superbowl

Wes Welker dropped the superbowl (as Shane Warne might have said) #superbowl #giants

If the Giants sign: Paul Fenaroli Eddie Gowins Dwayne Eley and Dj Porter = 2013 #SuperBowl

Don't go to bed before putting everything from your #Superbowl party away--it will make tomorrow's organizing so much easier!

Gmen did it again! Sorry Tom but the #Giants have ur card! #Superbowl

Hell of a #superbowl. Congrats to the new York giants and all of their fans! #nfl

1st Down.  Red Zone.  2 Minute Warning.  Hate to say I called this part, but #SuperBowl

Oh #SuperBowl was on? I didn't even watch -.- #Idc lol

Best thing about result is we don't have to hear Tom Brady compared to Joe Montana anymore. Montana never choked. #SuperBowl

choreographed the halftime? Well hell yes! #Superbowl

Falling into the end zone on yer behind when you don't want to? Maybe #SuperBowl's craziest play.

totally bailed on the #superbowl to watch #downtonabbey. Yep. Worth it!!!! :D

I have never cared less about a football game until today #superbowl

Why was the last 5 minutes pixelated on Directv? #NFL #epicfail #SuperBowl

I am so up on Blue right now I wanna fuck a smurf. #SuperBowl

Some real good games this weekend. Just wishing my team woulda won. #KUMU #SuperBowl

Ultimate showboat Sit down touchdown. #Giants #SuperBowl  #bbcsuperbowl

Money up. Backed #Giants b4 Dallas game to win #superbowl. $33.5/1 easy money #EliManning #GiantsWonTheSuperBowl

This is what Bill the cheater gets for cutting Myra Kraft's ghost before the game for a ghost to be named later. #SuperBowl #Patriots #NFL

Congrats Giants!!  Eli represented MS well!! #Superbowl

This year's Puppy Bowl was even better than last! You go, Animal Planet. ;) #superbowl

Not again. I think I hate this ny team more than the stupid jets now.  #superbowl

Too bad the Patriots couldn't do their SpyGate thing to get a win.  #itsnotcalledcheatingunlessyourecaught  #SuperBowl

to assuage my feelings of the Pats losing, I'm watching the #PuppyBowl halftime show with kitties!!  #SuperBowl

That was an absolutly amazing game. Eli Manning is the man. So proud to have him as my teams QB. #SuperBowl #ELIte #HOF

The Waff is pleased about the I am looking forward to watching the PuppyBowl on DVR.  Not a bad night overall. #sb46 #superbowl

12 Men on the field the next great defensive move! #giants #bigblue #superbowl

New York Giants won #SuperBowl XLVI

Hmmmm . Rush Limbaugh spotted in Kraft's suite and the #Giants go on to win. #SuperBowl

Bloomberg'd  Congratulations to the #SuperBowl Champion New York Giants! #AllIn

Very close game! Brady almost made it. Congrats to Eli and the NYG! #SuperBowl

Why you so mad about the #Superbowl if your team didn't even play in it?

Tom Brady is going to be crying while his wife is sucking him off  #SUPERBOWL

Cracking #Superbowl shame its all over quite like this American Football lark!

Now here's to another year's worth of insane Eli Manning overhype and ass-kissing! Good nite folks! #superbowl

If da #Saints make it too da #SuperBowl next year I am going..

I hate the rush to get the promo gear on the players #superbowl

Congrats New York Giants!! #SuperBowl great game!!

Yes Brady took some risks, but you don't win big if you don't play big, congrats to the Giants #superbowl

Yay! NY, the confetti has your name on it. #SuperBowl

Hey #TheGiants just won the #SuperBowl what are you going to next? Watch the season premiere of #TheVoice of course!

That old man sure likes getting his balls rubbed #SuperBowl

Eli Manning3 lucky nr 10 #Superbowl #Giants Champions!

Who would have imagined that the only REAL winner of the #SuperBowl was going to be CLINT EASTWOOD!? Go Clint!

Look at them all touching the trophy, similar scenes to when Katie Price walked down the street with her tits out #superbowl

The way those large men are touching that ball is making me uncomfortable. #SuperBowl #sb46

i bet the super bowl trophy got so many germs on it!!!!!!!!!!!! #superbowl

Why would u touch his hair?? See, niggas don't know how to behave when they on camera smh #SuperBowl

In the battle of Pornstars cheering during the #Superbowl beats Id b more than happy 2 celebrate/console either.

The stroking of the Lombardi trophy procession is incredibly awkward. #superbowl #Indy

If you would have told me midseason the #NYGiants were going to win the #superbowl and beat the #Packers, I would have said you were crazy

There won't be a cow milked in Manhattan tonight #superbowl

Lets just b #real every #SuperBowl will be close because if its a blowout people will turn off the game & the ad money gets wasted #politics

I can't wait until #Superbowl next year! A new team to support once I am sure they will win as well. #Giants #bandwagon

Yay Giants!! I knew it. Way to go Eli! What a game! #superbowl #2012

Couldn't sleep watched the #SuperBowl haven't a clue of rules/game/teams  but I couldn't stop watching it brilliant + #MadonnaSuperBowl FAB

That's a lot of bacteria right there on that silver ball. #Superbowl

That's a lot of man love for a trophy #superbowl

I certainly thought the Pats were going win this one. Great game. #Superbowl

All the #Patriots #superbowl apparel will go to 3rd world countries and to the kids on the feed the children commicals.

That ball is being treated like the Torah. #SuperBowl

I think a reporter just snuck a kiss in on the trophy. #SuperBowl #SBXLVI

Is Berry bringing out the Vince Lombardi Trophy or the Torah? #superbowl

If you weren't watching the #SUPERBOWL idk what you where doing with your life.

HW NOW.. Lol couldve done it 4hrs ago #superbowl

Even though my didn't make it, I'm happy for the Gmen!!!! #superbowl

The #Superbowl is the only time anyone actually wants to watch the commercials. #Epic

Did a #CBS reporter just kiss the Lombardi Trophy? #SuperBowl

Tonight's #superbowl makes Peyton's legacy a wee bit more complicated.

Yankees  Red Sox. #Giants  Patriots. What's up now, New England?! HAHAHAHAHA #SuperBowl Parade Tuesday !

Congrats to for hosting the best #superbowl party in town. And  for letting him in.

This trophy is being presented like a torah. #superbowl #highholydays

Still, compared the old days, this was lame. Back in there were at least 5-10 really unique spots.  #superbowl

The #Superbowl is over.. let's all get back to watching #Porn & masturbating rt

#SuperBowl Congrats #NewYorkGiants How Come #RaymondBerry & #RickSchroeder Look Just Alike? Retweet This If You Agree! #NewYorkKnicksOnDeck!

It's the last play of the #superbowl and you wanna be tweeting

Its not gay if you kiss the same spot on the #superbowl Trophy

Fab day which started with an 8:30 spin class followed by cooking for #SuperBowl  #Giants VICTORY!

I wish both teams coulda lost. Commie lib states. #nfl #SuperBowl

They need to get their mouths off that ball! #disgusting #SuperBowl

Worst bit of the #superbowl so far is that geeza holding the trophy and his terrible wig!

Underdogs the whole season and they did it again. Played Giants.#superbowl

Last for the #superbowl Sunday: Liga Privada Feral Flying Pig! #cigar #cigars #nowsmoking

That catch won the game. Just watched da #Giants win da #Superbowl with ma bruhs.

Why are they using the Anthem Of The Twelve Colonies? #Postgame #SuperBowl

Can a trophy file a sexual harassment claim? #SuperBowl

just watched my first #superbowl game and rly enjoyed it :)

Hella random ass ppl in the walk way of the #superbowl haha

I think I'd shove my way to the front so I'd be the first to kiss the trophy. No sloppy seconds for me! #Superbowl

It's amazing, so much passion! #superbowl

#SuperBowl couldn't get any better haha  #winning

Have you ever wondered how you'd feel if you ever won the #SuperBowl?

Congrats G-Men. You truly are a class organization and well deserving of being champions. Eli is the man! #SuperBowl  #SB46  #Indy

Can they finish up the un-important end of the #SuperBowl crap, and play #TheVoice already?

Hey, ladies. I'm sure Tom Brady will feel better about the #SuperBowl loss after he finds out that you think he's hotter than Eli. #SMH

The city of Indianapolis was the big winner for this years #superbowl

GIANTS WON!!! #TeamGiants The Patriots Probably in Their Locker Room in Hush Mode Cause They Lost To The Giants AGAIN in The #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl 2012 ! Craazyyyy! Never lost faith, GIANTSSSSSS

The January effects says stocks will rise this year but today's repeat of the 2008 #Superbowl may argue otherwise $SPX

Kinda pervy actually, how they are all fondling and kissing trophy, yes? #superbowl,  #nygiants

Does this gut know where he is or what he is holding? #superbowl

Today I had a photo shoot and wore red. Foreseeing things to come. #GIANTS #Superbowl WIN!

That guy on #superbowl walking with the trophy got his hair messed!!! Longest #AwkwardWalk ever!!! am I right

Whats the point in polishing the trophy it will get loads of finger prints on it by the time it gets to the podium #SuperBowl #BBCSuperbowl

Loving the caretaker bringing out the Vince Lombardi trophy. #Giants #bbcsuperbowl #SuperBowl

I don't care if the #Giants win every #SuperBowl from here on i still don't like em

There are people kissing the trophy that dont look like team members! : ) ##Giants #SuperBowl (Does every player gets one?)

By the end of that scenario that trophy got completely violated! Hahaha imagine if yu was that trophy.. Boi. #SuperBowl

14 players kissed the Championship Lambardi Trophy. lol awesome. #NFL #SUPERBOWL #GIANTS

At least the #Giants don't have to come up with a new web World Champions layout - it's ready to go #SuperBowl

Was it the players or the coaching why we never made it to #superbowl

Wonder how many germs are being passed by them kissing that trophy? #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Ok people seriously? Tom Brady was NOT the reason the Pats lost.

A movie made with real navy seals! Now we know what to expect when the home invasions begin! Yay! #SuperBowl #USA #CabinCr3w #NDAA #OBAMA

I don't mind all the pomp that surrounds the Lombardi. Well deserved! #superbowl #NYGiants

Glad the #Giants won &all, but that processional was too much - it's not the #CrossofChrist! #SuperBowl

Why does everyone hold and kiss the Lombardi trophy like its a titty? #SuperBowl

K, who designed the phallic-looking trophy! ICK! And it's even worse with the touching & kissing! #Superbowl

seeing grown men become child like around the trophy is something else #superbowl #nfl #NYGvNE

Singling out Ohio State players during the #SuperBowl. #TrueFan #KnowingYourAudience

Real heartache in my Boston-biased household, but luckily New England fans are accustomed to feeling like underdogs #Superbowl

Not really into football but dat 4th was pretty intense! Dude sat down on the touch down, glad they won #giants #superbowl

I legit thought that was Betty White up on that podium and was fixing to get super irritated. #Superbowl

i'm in some weird bizzaro demographic where i was excited for both the superbowl AND the season premiere of the voice. #superbowl

Did he just KISS that trophy after all those HANDS touched it??? SARS MOUTH FACE ASS!!! #SuperBowl

I want to be in a riot for no other reason than to riot.  I guess I can deal with internet rioting. #fuckthepolice #fuckthegiants #superbowl

Sooo tired but was worth staying up to see #superbowl

That game was awesome! Best touchdown ever by the Giants! Congrats! #Superbowl #Giants

I bet Raymond Berry even wonders how Manningham caught that damn ball. #superbowl

YES!!!! Giants win #SuperBowl. Happy to be yelling for the winning team. Ads could have been better though #sbads

Like devotees with one of those Catholic statues of Mary. #superbowl

Congrats to #NYGiants on winning this #SuperBowl I'm sure Peyton will be giving Eli a nice, big Manning hug soon. Feel

Imagine how much germs that silver football has now? #superbowl

If I'm a puppy, I don't want to be anywhere near Belichick's foot tonight.  #SuperBowl

I wonder if the NY Giants are going to #DisneySMMoms. Waitwrong event. Carry on. #SuperBowl

Listening to after the #superbowl to hear if gets some airtime tonight.

What a great game!!! YEAH GIANTS!!! #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Raymond Berry (ex Patriots coach) brings trophy in to be presented to the Giants.

Bummed out for all of the men in my life, who are taking this loss hard. #superbowl. #patriotsfan

Is Tom Coughlin a Hall of Fame coach now? #SuperBowl

Someone want to tell Rex Ryan that the best team in NY is the Giants. #SuperBowl

Thank you Mr & Mrs Manningham! are world champions!! o/ #superbowl

Can Tell by my attitude that I'm most Deft. front #NY #nygiantswin #superbowl

Old ass white lady holding the trophy, will she did keep coach dick happy lmao #superbowl

Why's Peggy Mitchell holding the trophy? #Superbowl

I'm still really upset though. I had myself all invested.. oh well. That's life. #superbowl #patriots #ineedsomechocolate

I think my heart grew eight times bigger. #SUPERBOWL #GiantsForever

My TL:- #Superbowl- The Giants Won Yay! :D- The Giants Bitch Asses Won -____-- Fuck The Superbowl The ________

Speaking of the #SuperBowl I'm craving Mexican food.

That has to be the most awkward prelude to a trophy presentation. Have it ready, present it and then let the players enjoy #superbowl

Who was old guy in yellow coat they made carry the trophy about 100 yards? #SuperBowl

Have to say that when they were 7-7 I thought the #Giants were done, wouldn't even reach the play-offs. Fantastic achievement. #SuperBowl

here at the Embassy, people showed up at 5:30 a.m. to watch the #SuperBowl live!

Wow. Awkward!!! Former NE coach presents the trophy to the Giants. Way to think that one thorough NFL. #SuperBowl

Why is Madonna holding the Lombardi trophy on that platform? #SuperBowl

There should be a Girl with A dragon Tattoo Theme for the Trophy Presentation!!! #SuperBowl

Totally worth staying up late for. Nerve racking last couple of minutes though. Go Giants!!! Just gotta get home now. #superbowl

It's going to be copied and pasted here by either the Gillard/Rudd or Abbott/Turnbull crews#superbowl

Wow #Madonna filled the field w homos for the #superbowl. Is this a first? Vogueing invented by queer kids of color now on the 50

Ewww that trophy all nasty now. People kissing it, old people caressing it #SuperBowl

What's Betty White doing up there with the Vince Lombardi trophy? #superbowl

my awesome #superbowl tweeting gained me three spam followers. SURE I'D LOVE TO WEBCAM WITH YOU RANDO SLUTTY CHICK WHO'S PROBS A DUDE #ugh

Is there a more clutch QB than Eli?  He owns the 4th quarter. #Superbowl #NFL

So clearly Adrianna Lima was pretty this #SuperBowl ad season.

Betty white looks a lot different without make-up. #SuperBowl

What did you like better: the #superbowl, the ads or #Madonna ?

lmao  The #Superbowl Trophy got Sars on it  I wouldn't touched that thing if u paid me  Ik u see what im seein

BTW Giants fans, enough about Eli and Coughlin. They're great. No more questioning. C'mon now. #superbowl

#superbowl #patriots #toucherandrich Bill Buckner is going to kiss Wes Welker on the mouth

Guess who was right about the #SuperBowl again this year? That's right, this chick:) Congrats Giants! Sorry Patriots

The #Giants have so much heart. They never ever give up. #NFL #SuperBowl

The old lady that accosted Terry Bradshaw now holds the Lombardi Trophywhat a funny trip it has been #SuperBowl

All these #SuperBowl loses aren't good for my pacemaker #patriots

Great to recognize New Jersey in the victory speech. #superbowl

Peyton fuckin up!! Lil brother pissing on him #Superbowl

Congrats 2 the #Superbowl Champion #NEWYORK #GIANTS! I recommend waking up 2morrow & pursuing your goals&dreams w/the same passion they did

Best #SuperBowl commercial? The M&M one(;

Sorry dude, but Packer fans are the most loyal fans in the league. #SuperBowl

Wait a minute. Browns fans are more loyal than Giants fans. We don't win #SuperBowl games but we still cheer.

Why is the crazy old lady holding the #superbowl trophy?!  Give it to the players like in the Ridiculous trophy presentation.

Waiting for the World Heavyweight Championship to pop up. #SuperBowl

Waiting for Kanye West to grab the mic #fb #superbowl #nfl

But the funniest commercial for the #SuperBowl was the yogurt ii think..

A photog too close to the action got the celebratory Gatorade bath.  I think it was some kind of a Nikon.  #superbowl

Sigh, really thought the Pats would take it #superbowl

Ohh how I loved the #SuperBowl commercials(:

First ever #Superbowl I've watched; got decent towards the end! Still not a patch on Rugby League! #padsforpansies

The Giants fan base would have just exploded! #Superbowl

Kids you think football players are rich? That guy in the suit receiving the trophy (owner) is RICH! #SuperBowl

To think, I almost boycotted this game. What a battle to the finish! #SuperBowl #sb46

Giants squeaked into the playoffs. Beat NFC's #1 GB and #2 SF and the beat AFC's #1 NE. Most impressive Superbowl run ever #SuperBowl #nfl

Wow, even Cee Lo Green couldn't save that performance. #Madonna #SuperBowl

Best Week Ever I'm Proud to Say we had the #SuperBowl Here in our City Indianapolis! Go Giants!!!! :)

Madonna, Kylie Minogue's wants her tour back. #Superbowl #reductive

Okay, kids, I'm going to bed. Night all.  #SuperBowl #bollocks

Congratulations to the city of New York, the NY Giants, and Giants' fans #SuperBowl

Wow, the Championship hats are hideous and generic. #EpicFail #SuperBowl

World Champions of a sport only one country plays! Woo! #SuperBowl #BBCsuperbowl #worldchampionsofamerica

I hope I don't look so old when I'm old. #SuperBowl

What a Game. What a spectacle. Believe the Hype #Superbowl

That was the dumbest scene I've seen in a while! #SuperBowl Vince Lombardi trophy presentation.

Its mighty ironic the #SuperBowl Champion #Giants could not beat my #Redskins . . lol #dmv #dc

Tom Coughlin's capillaries seem really happy. #SuperBowl

#superbowl haha that name card gave it away!!!

Blah blah blah #NBC Im tired of the #superbowl I want to see #thevoice! NOT!

Is that madonna holding the trophy after she took her makeup off? #SuperBowl #madonna

Watched 39 seconds of the #SuperBowl only thing I missed was the #commercials

Congratulations to the New York Giants! #superbowl Champions - New England Patriots - Thanks for a great season!

Sunday night football is finally over! Lo mejor del #SuperBowl fue Madonna!

Glad the #SuperBowl is over now everybody can shutup about it!

No one give a shit about Tom Brady & the Brady bunch!!! They lost!!! #GIANTS #SuperBowl

And the countdown clock to Giants fans wanting Tom Coughlin fired begins. #superbowl

Thank god the giants won cuz Tom Brady is a d-bag! #SuperBowl

Good night, morning & afternoon to you all fellow #SuperBowl watchers :) #TwitterOff #MacceOff zzzzzzzzzz

The better team won. Good game. down to the last play.  #SuperBowl #Giants

Good ass game.Giants took another one from Brady #Superbowl

Brilliant #superbowl apologies for getting my prediction wrong. I said Giants by 3, they done it by 4.

The New York win #SuperBowl 46 defeating the New England 21-17 #SB46 (via

You couldn't go wrong with this game. Too great teams. As a New Yorker im proud of the Giants!! #superbowl #giants

Thank you fans who bet against me and therefore paying for my #SuperBowl XLVI Championship gears =]

exactly. #SuperBowl has become #marchmadness. Just get in the playoffs. Regular season = meaningless. #Giants were 9-7!

gotta do what u gotta do. 20 yrs from now he'll be wondering why he did it. #SuperBowl

OMG!!! U Monica????? Are U Watching #SuperBowl??

#Patriots fans. Now you can add the name Mario beside David Tyree to your #SuperBowl nightmares. #NFLNetwork #Giants

This is like dejavu. I remember the same exact feelings with next to me four years ago. #superbowl

This part here is the worst tradition in pro sports, giving the owners the trophy and talking to them first. #SuperBowl

YESSS!!!!! GO GIANTS! WE DA BEST! #Giants #SuperBowl #EpicWinning #CryBradyCry #Wearethechampions

ewww it lost its shine its all dirty now #superbowl #vincelombarditrophy

#Giants deserve it ! But Brady is out of this World. Great #Superbowl Game

Eli Manning is such a redneck, weirdly handsome though. I would. #superbowl

What exactly did Eli do to earn being the MVP? #SuperBowl

I usually like a defensive game, but this just did not inspire. Oh well. lol #superbowl

Am I the ONLY one that gets emotional when those big guys are petting the trophy? #pmshereitcomes #superbowl

How come there isn't anyone thanking the #Jets for playing so shitty on Christmas Eve to help make this possible?#SuperBowl

I would have never kissed the trophy.. #justsayin #bacteria #superbowl #XLVII #disgusting #germs

Well,after about mini 5 heart attacks I'm going to sleep for 2 hours and go to work with a wide smile o my face #Ibelieveineli #SuperBowl

Thats only Bcuz his team jus lost the #superbowl

I can't wait for somebody to drop the Lombardi Trophy.  #superbowl

The #SuperBowl would be a great game if it were just 6 minutes long instead of 60.

Pats basically let them win but. Congrats #giants. #superbowl (prev tweet meant to be high road)

Yessss GIANTS!! Eli Manning MVP and I won the bet wooooo! #Superbowl #showmethemoney

It's one of the story lines we wanted to see. Eli wins another #Superbowl and on his brothers turf!

#SuperBowl The MVP should've either gone to Manningham or the punter

The #SuperBowl stadium didn't collapse so no one died. #sadday

Who would you do? Eli Manning or Tom Brady?  #superbowl

Shout out to everyone who lost money on that game. Yall #winning. #Superbowl

Should I be excited or dreading working three blocks from the victory parade route? LOL #superbowl

Thank you to and for the commentary this evening. I've been chilling in bed getting updates #SuperBowl

The secret is out. Eli is MVP. See Dan Patrick's script. #SuperBowl MVP #Dan _Patrick

#superbowl champions thats the only way to smack haters upside the head #giants

Wait..who was going for the #PatriotsUmm yeah, sorry #GIANTS won this #SuperBowl ;D

Eli should give a shout out to his brother's vertebrae.  #NFL #superbowl

Second #SuperBowl thought: I don't think I've ever seen an accidental touchdown before.

Got my head right in 2012 My #Giants won the #SuperBowl in 2012 now all i want is this 2012. God please make this happen Lol

yah, this is why the world hates us, we have the #superbowl only for American to see who's the best team world wide

Oh that's shitty to ask Eli about Peyton during his moment. #SuperBowl

The #Giants winning the #SuperBowl is like Obama getting elected for sports fans. Like, exactly.

I think I chose the right mug tonight. #superbowl

The #Giants won the #Superbowl. Is this a good thing? The only team I'd heard of was The #Packers and they weren't playing Um Good game?

If i ever watch #SuperBowl it will be too soon. Pointless. What was it all about. NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL. Up their own asse

Nevermind it's already too late, that was clearly a car commercial mixed in with the interviews #superbowl

Dont feel too bad for Tom Brady. He gets to go home to Gisele and this mansion!  #Superbowl

#OleMiss Eli Manning joins only 3 other guys as 2x MVP of #SuperBowl: Bart Starr (#Bama) Terry Bradshaw (#LATech) Tom Brady (#Michigan)

Best thing about this Giants win is that everyone's gunna be in a good mood for a few days. #Superbowl #Giants

Okay #SuperBowl get off the tv so #TheVoice can come on..

Close one in the end. Patriots were let down by a couple of catches in the final minute. Aw well theres aways next year #superbowl

thanks for those RTs Meghan. Great game and we had fun with the #PulseAnalytics LiveStream of the #SuperBowl

Hey and I think I should be able to wear my jersey tomorrow. Just saying. #SuperBowl

The only thing I took away from the #superbowl is that my favorite number is 80 now.

I wonder what kids from a 3rd world country will be wearing 2012 Patriots world champ shirts. #superbowl #nfl #nyg #pats

All those Giants Superbowl XLVI CHAMPIONS hats & shirts are also already on their way to the Congo. #superbowl

I understand it's the #SuperBowl but why all of y'all have to kiss the trophy?!?

CONGRATS TO THE #GIANTS FOR WINNING THE #SUPERBOWL WEAR THE HAT PROUDLY CUZ YOU CAN NOTCH ANOTHER #NEWYORK WIN OVER #BOSTON

#TWINKIES! I just watched and voted for this #SuperBowl XLVI ad from #Chevy. Check out #2012 here:

How do you drink champagne out of that thing? #StanleyCup #SuperBowl #NHL #NFL

Hope #NYGs donate the #SuperBowl car to a worthy charity!

Great #SuperBowl and commercials. Ready to see the in the 2013 Super Bowl XLVII game in N.O. at the M-B Superdome.

Giants SuperBowl champs the real red white n blue! #SuperBowl #Freebandz #Myteamwinning #Yourteamlosing

Look at da bad boy whip they gave him #SuperBowl

Best thing about the #SuperBowl is that no one mentioned #Tebow during the game. I actually feel bad about hashtagging him just now. #Dick

saying 'world champions' is stupid. america is the only country that plays the game. egotists. #superbowl

cant understand this at all but was still exciten #superbowl

Congrats to the NY Giants!! Fun fact: they will hoist a trophy designed by  #style #greatgame #Superbowl

Living for mini Dame Edna working her trophy-touch moment. #SuperBowl

3 hours and ive got to be up and go to college damn #SuperBowl keeping me awake

Celebrating The #SuperBowl after party with homework :/ jaja goodnight

My favorite part of the #SuperBowl was tweeting a joke before FTW!

do you think anyone at all can win a #SuperBowl that's involved with the #Browns right now?  That's the real question

Chevy Sonic bug on Car was funny. #Superbowl

And that, my friends, is why football will always be the greatest sport on earth. #superbowl

Next year..the Browns! #Superbowl (Im drunk af)

Picked the perfect day to shop, primo parking and empty stores thanks super bowl Sunday #superbowl

Why is it that the #Superbowl is the best choreographed show in the world and the trophy presentaion is always a complete shambles?

Now that the #SuperBowl is over we can finally get back to the #LingerieHockeyLeague.

Congratulations to Eli Manning, two-time #Superbowl MVP, and the rest of the You did #NY proud. #congratsgiants

That Super Bowl trophy has been kissed by so many dudes in the past 15 minutes it should probably get tested for herpes. #superbowl

Matthew Broderick reprises 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' for a Honda's #Superbowl 2012 commercial (Yes, it's an Ad)

Bridget Moynahan set Tom Brady up again. #superbowl

I have to live with the fact that the only time i will ever see the #Eagles win the #SuperBowl is in madden #depressing

#superbowl BBC sticking with interviews and post-match analysis, Sky went to studio after Eli for a quick goodnight and gone until Autumn.

Just woke up and missed the whole #SuperBowl     I might have to reexamine my life when I actually need to set my alarm to 10:00PM

The Giants Rules! Beats the Patriots 21-17 to win the #Superbowl. What a spectacular performance.

Someone needs to take that young chap in the studio to a decent tailor #superbowl

Kids, stay in school, or else you'll grow up to talk like these guys. #superbowl

Superbowl is good but give me the trophy lifting of the world cup, FA cupOr Champions League any day!! Theres no emotion!! #SuperBowl

Giant Eli owned tiny Tom #GoGiants #Giants #Superbowl

You know what's crazier than Eli having more Super Bowl victories than Peyton? Tebow has none. #superbowl

With win Giants become 4th winningest franchise tied with Packers #SuperBowl

Giants now tied with Green Bay with four #SuperBowl wins, Patriots tied with Denver, Minnesota and Buffalo with four

its basically whatever team wins quarterback gets it #superbowl it was a tale of 2 catches,1 dropped and 1 won the game #giants

Even Giants fans don't think Eli deserves the #SuperBowl MVP.

#patriots haven't won since spyware. Let's go #giants #SuperBowl

I'm not a athlete but Im guessin heres 1 thing you shouldnt do #superbowl. NEVER let ya opponents score on you with 2 minutes left smh

As they keep kissing the #SuperBowl trophy, I can't help but wonder, have they seen Contagion? Outbreak? #germs

I am not a Giants fan but I am pumped for all the #twitterblueshirts  who are. #congrats #celebrate #LetsGoRangers #superbowl

I actually thought Pats were gonna win :( #superbowl

How many of you wonder how many Herpes bacteria are on that #Superbowl Trophy now?

Great #SuperBowl, great but not enough #VinceLombardi come back

In case there's any confusion, it's the New York FOOTBALL Giants. People, there hasn't been a NY BASEBALL Giants since 1957. #SuperBowl

#Superbowl never seems to fail to deliver. Watching him try to stop on the 1 yard line was absolutely unbelievable. Great match!

Yes an entrepreneur with an idea can change the world. & she's just as likely to be female. #superbowl

Can I interest anyone in a van full of #Patriots #SuperBowl 2012 Champions t-shirts? I'll throw in the van! #NFL #Giants

There was a draugur during the half-time show? #SuperBowl #skyrim

Alabama won #BCS , Giants won #SuperBowl , now lets go Syracuse and Miami Heat

Missed the #SuperBowl commercials?  All are here  .  My fav is the #Sketcher moonwalking pooch.  What about you?

Cee lo is the only one who actually sings LIVE! #Madonna #Superbowl

Damn Lost your wife, Lost the #SuperBowl ? It's looking good for you bruh! Lol

Nevermind we didn't win, good game all round and it seems the people I watched with took another step closer to enjoying the NFL #Superbowl

Great atmosphere in Montreal bar for #SuperBowl and I called the winner! Well done giants.

After that boring, poorly played (save for a couple drives) #SuperBowl, I may join in his sports agnosticism-thing.

In New York concrete jungle where dreams are made of,there's nothing you can't do now you're in New York #Giants #SuperBowl

Would have loved this pic if the Giants had lost -  #SuperBowl

I bet I know where #EliManning is going after the #SuperBowl.

Really good Superbowl. Giants won, like I said they would. #superbowl

Congrats to New York Giants; World Champions of Handegg #superbowl

If #Giants run out of confetti, they can use same confetti saved for #Patriots Red/White/Blue #SuperBowl

Shit result! Hate Manning! Had a great night with people. Wings, hot dogs, & pulled pork quesadillas! #superbowl #nfl

War heads during the #SuperBowl they weren't sour or anything lol

#NYGiants beat #Patriots 21-17 to win the #SuperBowl  Thoughts on the game? Worth the hype? Ever wort

Lots of these ads are a lot worse on TV than when I previewed them on Youtube #superbowl

Highlight of the #SuperBowl Hernandez cooking after a TD. #TYBG lmao

G-men! Congrats to the New York football Giants. Love seeing the Pats go home! #SuperBowl

If you're sitting in the owners box at the #superbowl you shouldn't have a replica jersey on, it should at least be stichted! #coldhardfact

Looks like $38 lift tickets at tomorrow. Congrats GMEN. #superbowl

#superbowl-if refs don&#39;t call that b.s. holding the lead would&#39;ve been 16-3 in the first half, refs are CHEATERS

Good game but a trophy you can't drink out of that gets presented to Grandma and Grandpa?  Figure it out boys. #superbowl

How can a team called Patriots lose? Clearly Obama's fault. #superbowl

im still goin to sleep good tonight cause i know that my team made it to the #SUPERBOWL while everyone elses team was watching it

No postgame interview from Belichick? What a sore loser. #spygate #SuperBowl

The dissonance of mocking the #SuperBowl in the safety of my home while shit hits the fan in #Syria isn't lost on me.    1/2

Best #superbowl ad ever set the tone for a cultural revolution (Apple 1984), now it's about a cheap laugh. What happened? #brandbowl

New York Giants! (We're big fans) #superbowl

In lieu of post-game availability, the Patriots will send Newt Gingrich out to conduct a two-hour press conference. #SuperBowl

Now that #SuperBowl is over, it's back to gearing up for my #NominateADate adventure. Who will you nominate?

It's a shame either team had to win. #richgetricher #superbowl #giants #patriots

RT Now that the NFL season is finally over, I can get back to things that matter like Flossing & Laundry. #superbowl

Idgaf about thee #SuperBowl my team ain't playing

I didn't know my parents could hate so blindly. I guess this Brady character had it coming. #SuperBowl

I climbed Mt Everest in 2 hrs, boarded back to the bottom and still had enough energy to go play in the #SuperBowl #ThatsHowDaddyDoesIt

Much respect to Mario Manningham for the biggest catch of his career when it really mattered. #SuperBowl

#Tweet to Tom Brady's wife after the big game #SuperBowl

The #superbowl is over now its time for #thevoice I camt wait haha

this #superbowl wasent that great. pats lost, comercials went that great, abd madonna, well, u know. going to bed early. #nighttwitter :(

Belichick avoids the press like a petulant child. #spoiledsport #SuperBowl

The best thing about this #SuperBowl , was the fucking Half-Time . . .

I prob a pulled muscle from jumping up and down! Dude it's an amazing feeling #Superbowl

Didn't win the #SuperBowl pool but did win a free round of golf courtesy #thanksgiants #doesthatincludecart?

Enjoyed watching #superbowl, starting to understand the game. Still think basketball & baseball are more my thing, besides soccer that is.

It's very difficult for me to feel bad for people who make multi million dollars a year whether they win or lose one game #SuperBowl

#doritos #superbowl commercial with the baby rocked my socks!

This is probably the 1st #superbowl I've ever seen, I bet on #Giants and they won! Gr8!

i still have an attitude seeing how I missed all but the last 57 sec of the #SuperBowl

Hey, what happened with the #Superbowl? I passed out after the #Avengers ad.

I am the King of #superbowl betting, now 4-2 in the big game, most analytics sites can't give you better, thanks #colts for killing #sb44

Welker, Hernandez, and possibly Branch all missed big catches that should've been caught. #Patriots #SuperBowl

That away #Giants for the big #superbowl win!! GO HOME Tom Brady you can't compete with ELI

Eli is the Obama of QBs. He'll make you crazy because he never gets angry, never gets excited. But, in the end, he wins. #superbowl

Not cool having so many repeat commercials during #superbowl. I'm looking at you #Ford #Toyota #Honda

If the Giants win that proves the key to winning the #SuperBowl is to have half your team on IR and get the Wild Card spot

Who cares about the #superbowl when you can watch on beat out :)

Well I lost twenty bucks on the #SuperBowl. I did like the forth quarter thought it was the best.

M.I.A. didn't flip off that camera it was just a simple #bollywood hand movement. #justkiddingsheflippeditthebird #sb46 #superbowl

The #SuperBowl. A bad day for advertising. A good day for the #Giants.

Paolo, what do you make of Eli Manning? What he has done in his 2 #superbowl wins is quite simply great. Best QB In NFL IMO.

Congrats from being told u would never walk again, to winning the #superbowl as a rookie #winfromwithin #inspiration #weareBC

Taped the #SuperBowl so I could watch the commercials. Wow! Madonna's still got it!  What an awesome half-time show!

More people tuned in in the UK to watch Madonna than the #superbowl!

The #GoogleChrome commercial that just played was better than 95% of the #SuperBowl commercials. Saw me some too. #whoopwhoop

#Superbowl that was a good ass game!!!! The Giants stayed strong til the end and came out with the win.

Am I the only one who thought the #Superbowl would actually be in a shape of a 'bowl' and not a 'ball?' #whyisitcalledasuperbowl?

The one commercial that wasn't replaced by canadian programming during the #superbowl #avengers  I hope it's good

With 2011 season record of 9-7, that is a record for least wins for #superbowl winner.  They sure caught fire in post season.

#Superbowl, I don't understand it, dont watch it and yet I know that I'll be reading/hearing about it for the nextoh joy

My Luke and  --Goodluck charm? Congrats! #superbowl #superbowlchamps

#thatawkwardmoment when the commercials are even worse than the #SuperBowl

I feel like Taylor Kitsch is the true MVP of this #SuperBowl

Best commercial not shown in the United States? Budweiser's Big Game. Google it. #brandbowl #hockey #SuperBowl #Sbchat

Will Ferrell made a #SuperBowl ad that only aired in Nebraska. Enjoy:

How to summarize #SuperBowl XLVI? Cruz juggle catch, Manningham crazy-ass catch, Bradshaw butt-down! And of course Eli the man! :-)

RT I really wish Buffalo Bills would permanently move north of the border #Toronto. #nfl #SuperBowl

The last couple of minutes of the #SuperBowl confused me, but it's too late to try and figure it out..

New England only beat one team that ended the year with a winning record.  #SuperBowl

When you are playing in the #SuperBowl you can't make mistakes like that in the 4th quarter.

Congrats to the NFL for using the #SuperBowl promoted trend on Twitter. I think it helped get viewers.

Everybody from NY now .smh fuckin flops . Im from Indy and my team don't play football . But we make hits #RSGLIFE  #superbowl

Best #SuperBowl commercials, 2nd place: Detroit auto manufacturers ad featuring Clint Eastwood. Somber, but well done and effective.

I still hace 1 question about #SuperBowl XLVI, how much were the most expensive tickets?? Can't find that info

#MUSIC NEWS: How Do You Rate #Madonna #SuperBowl Performance?  Who Should Play Next Year? - Read

In the final three minutes of the #SuperBowl tonight, there were an average of 10,000 Tweets per second. (Twitter Co

#Beanpot semifinals are tomorrow, it is more important to me than the #superbowl #GONU

Next time, #SuperBowl can hire #StreetCapital for the halftime show. Give Madonna and LMFAO a run for their embarrassingly, untalented money

The #SuperBowl only means one thing to me 2 weeks til #SpringTraining. #pelvicthrust

might have been but in most cases, pro sports teams do this in preparation to flick the switch if they do win #superbowl

If the pats won I 'd be celebrating right now but they didnt so I have to study stats .great #SuperBowl

Honestly, #TheVoice is sixty-million times better than the #SuperBowl.

Dangfirst the #Giants win the #SuperBowl, then my January Sampler makes site -   It's been a good day

#SuperBowl results bad news for #GOP. Last time #Giants beat #Patriots in a Super Bowl, #Obama won an election. #tcot #p2

lol can be a cruel medium as the reflection of public opinion. But public never was that fond of lip-syncing. #SuperBowl

loved in his #Superbowl commercial and now watching ridiculousness.

Agree  is responding to fans responding to their #superbowl ads.  Honest hard work today. #sb46 #brandbowl

3 coaches currently in #NFL with multiple #SuperBowl wins..Tom Coughlin #NYGiants, Mike Shanahan #Redskins, and Bill

The Dallas Cowboys have 1 playoff victory since 1996. Good nightsigh. #Superbowl #sb46 #dfw

Oh yes, the #Gaints did just win the #SuperBowl! #winning

The Pats #SuperBowl victories should have an asterisk on them like the steroid era in baseball. Cheaters!

. nice job on running #thevoice after the #SuperBowl. So many people watching that I'd never expect cc

my G+ is totally blowin up over the #superbowl

Thank u Clint for such an amazing #superbowl spot. Choked up.

Since I was watching the #SuperBowl about 45 minutes behind real time, is it safe to Twitter again?

extended my losing streak of betting on winner and covering #SuperBowl spread to 7 years in a row.this is one streak i'm NOT PROUD OF. :(

Great #SuperBowl game, some good ads, and watched it all with my baby and fam. I also won $250 on some squares :D Great night!

#TheVoice is really cool :D lifted my spirits after watching the #SuperBowl

#SUPERBOWL was dumb as hell this year i wasted my Time

Bowling is obviously not important if its on ESPN when the #SuperBowl is on. #nobodycaresaboutbowling

I'm gonna guess large but I've heard good things about the tailor #SuperBowl #bELIeve

You dont seem to happy bout that lmaoo #superbowl

Giving lots of credit to #Madonna and the entire half time crew. Little lady and crew put on a very entertaining show. #Superbowl

Friday from Rebecca Black was more amusing than the #SuperBowl

#superbowl was a close game, but happy that cheribundi served the well!

Honestly the Monday after the #SuperBowl should be a national holiday #needsleep

Photo: #Patriot fans in disbelief as #Giants fans rejoice #SuperBowl (Taken with Instagram at New York City,

I'm glad is trying to make a comeback during the #SuperBowl. It's nice to see apps from 3 years ago rocking the 2012

You know what I did instead of watch the #Superbowl ? I got fucked, ;).

too late #SuperBowl champs are allowed to speak.

I forget, did #Menino agree to take diction lessons and #Bloomberg was going to take dick? #SB46 #Superbowl #Pats

I always sleep through the half time show. #SuperBowl

New York Giants won superbowl! Is this the sign from God to me? Perhaps it is. #superbowl

My first #Superbowl and a good one, congrats #giants but my #49ers will be back next year, #Go pats if he'd just caught for the touchdown

Every #Superbowl has been down to the wire finish the past few years

Anyone else notice how EVERY Hollywood movie #SuperBowl commercial was about WAR and the END of the WORLD? About 7 of them. Coincidence?

At the #SuperBowl halftime show #Madonna schools everyone on live stage entertainment and intermediate S&M moves ht

Congrats to the NYGiants on winning! But let's get real, you're not world champions. You didn't play the world #Superbowl #giants #fb

the #SuperBowl commercials weren't  has funny has last years

gave himself arm hickeys. #superbowl #mourning /cc

Live from the couch, Norman Chad brings you his #SuperBowl journal:

Seems like we've had several #superbowl s lately in which the regular season performance of the winner proved irrelevant to its success.

Looks like big crowd gathering at UMass.  #superbowl

What was your favorite #SuperBowl commercial? Let us know!

Haha I don't even know that score from the game Shows how much I pay attention:) #SuperBowl #forreal

RT New England lost. Only a matter of time before they take a page from  and the clam chowder riots start. #superbowl

Never watched #TheVoice before.  Kind of ashamed at how enjoyable I'm finding it. This is what #SuperBowl wrought.

If we wouldn't have traded for #Eli would we have even smelled a #Superbowl with #PhillipRivers

Peyton now wondering when he'll see the sun again as he now stands in the shadow of his kid brother. #superbowl

Anybody got any wild turkey I need to get fucked up and forget about this bullshit #Superbowl

#superbowl I'm sorry, but madonna should not have even attempted those flips, it made her look like an amateur.

Here's the entire OKGO #Superbowl commercial, complete with 1100+ homemade instruments, 55 pianos, & a ton of guitar

Church had half the usual attendance today #superbowl

Giants, Madonna, stolen tickets, I got to escort someone out, photos, & kisses. That's a good #SuperBowl!

OK #NFL fans, now that #Superbowl is over, get ready for BETTER American-style football in June: #CFL! #ThisIsOurLeague #OurBallsAreBigger

Brady sucks Eli's dick again. #SuperBowl #Giants #PatsNation

NY Giants win the Super Bowl = never give up, even when others write you off! #SuperBowl

I am so stuffed from eating so much food tonight during the #Superbowl I can hardly move

Different year, same result.   #giants over #patriots .  I won some goods money too!   #superbowl

Congratulations to the NY Giants! What an intense game! Take a load off and visit our partner casinos next week! We can help! #superbowl

Last 2 minutes of #Superbowl more tense than other 58 minutes.Total luck for #Giants.If a #Patriot caught that ball at 00:00,it'd be a shame

So, what did everyone think of the commercials during the #superbowl? We're stoked to see their film.

Curious to see the overnight ratings for the #SuperBowl and how they compare with other Super Bowls.

Dis wat happen when #superbowl come around .. Lmao .. Wake up nigga

Just another #Superbowl post. but the only redeeming quality about the half time show was MIA.

I think wins for best #superbowl commentary for his #fridaynightlights themed tweets.  At least I knew what HE was talking about

I didn't have any nachos. I had a salad with a glass of wine. No post-#superbowl gorge.

#Madonna kicked ass! She killed it! #SuperBowl WHOOT!

Can't wait to see the vid of Madonna's performance, lots of rave reviews about it! So far I only saw her photos - very fierce! #Superbowl

hey belichik & brady, it's tough to win without cheating, huh? #Giants #patriots #superbowl #bigbluerules

Too bad for the Patriots. #BigSigh #SuperBowl #BetterLuckAnotherTime Congrats to NY!

plus the website went down after the commercials. You spend  $3M & the site crashes??!  #wasteof$ #SuperBowl

Oh well sorry Patriots Yall lost in the rematch AGAIN!! #superbowl

Didnt even watch da #SuperBowl jst chill wit da mainthing.

Watching Madonna rock out in the Superbowl Halftime Show makes you forget that she's like 50+. Damn. #Halftimeshow #Superbowl

Who's the sketchy toga guy tricklining at Madonna #SuperBowl halftime show?

I think the #SuperBowl should be moved to Monday and made a national holiday. Seriously. #fb #NFL #SB46

#TeenMom Farrah Abraham Loved Madonna's #SuperBowl Half Time Show! -

Tuesday, helmet headed Giants in spandex waving sparkly rings will parade through #NYC. And u thought Madonna drew in the gays.#superbowl

Yep  NY must b cray goin right now  happy fans and concerned cops. #superbowl

Eli Manning is the first quarterback to win two postseason starts against Tom Brady (elias) #SuperBowl

I think the sports reporter from Channel 7 was going to start crying as he started his report tonight. #SuperBowl

A guy who's been to the #SuperBowl the past 18 yrs said Indy has been the best host city. That's awesome. It's been fun. #HoosierHospitality

Ad a great #superbowl party with Katie zogg at club subway!!!

OMGGGGG! The production! MADONNA singing Vogue! #MDNA #SuperBowl

Why does it seem that the Patriots can't beat the Giants when it counts? #PatriotsForLife #Superbowl

Well, the #SuperBowl is like Christmas, a lot of hype and nowit's all over!  Congrats Eli & the Giants!!!

In #Modells getting the #Superbowl tshirts, this line is #CRAY!!!!! #FTW #GIANTS  Sporting Goods

Thx #madonna 4 bringing out  the #iworkoutguys 4 the halftime show. Y not the Ying Yang twins and Sanjaya 4 nxt years #SuperBowl halftime.

The best Super Bowl commercials had dogs in them.  What does that mean, exactly?  #SuperBowl

How do you know it's choke time for the Patriots? They're playing the in the #superbowl #champions

Props to #TomBrady, he played well. But Eli's blood is the blood of a champion. Now its #PeytonManning turn to win his second #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl never mind that united v Chelsea now that was a game xx

#Superbowl in New Orleans next year i think i need to start preparinghmm

Don't think I can watch mc top ten since therss no rappers on the panel..tats like hvin.a singer give me the  #SuperBowl report  #nogo

OMG THE GIANTS WONNNNhonestly I don't really care, I'm not a die-hard football fan - but we have to learn it in P.E. Bleh #superbowl

Ooh!  One of the speakers for the Business Conference this year was in a Best Buy #SuperBowl commercial!

I guess #nep had better chance over #nyg #superbowl

#superbowl Sunday yaay!! There are more #Giants fans than Patriots rite? =P LIVE show from the Superbowl after! =)

by the way, that David Beckham H&M commercial during the #SuperBowl was so waste. They disgusted me by playing that

I still think this was not fair, Tom Brady is too sexy to lose #SuperBowl

Ppl saying The Giants were lucky! If luck means a #SuperBowl, ill take it

Congrats to the Giants!!  They earned this title!  Welker choked  big time for the Pats!  I love seeing Brady humbled#SuperBowl

Now that I'm done live blogging the #superbowl and #thevoice , he's demanding 100% of my attention.

Yes I was very, very nervous during the game with my friends watching the Super Bowl.  I thought I would pass out.  #SuperBowl

Now that the #superbowl is over it's back to being  shitty indianapolis.

Im posting my #favorite #SuperBowl #commercial on my #facebook.  Let's hope I can find them.

Had a good time watching the Giants beat the Patriots at the Fekany's. #Superbowl

All this #SuperBowl hoopla for the makes me sad. #sunsfan

hey, on the upside, will be pouring so enjoy that! #craftbeer #superbowl

I can't believe I'm expected to pay $53 for a #Giants #SuperBowl sweatshirt. #outlandish

If 5% of revenue made from the #superbowl went to services for victims of child abuse.the world would change for the b

So wrong, yet so funny! #patriots #superbowl

I didnt care who won the #superbowl bc my team didn't make it, the #SaskRoughriders lol! Halftime show was ok, #Madonna seemed super slow

isn't it funny that the NFC has won the #SuperBowl 3 years in a row when they're supposedly the weaker conference?

Not going to even talk about the #SuperBowl on here .. I already took out all my anger on my other twitter .

Overall #SB46 was a great game #commercials didn't live up to #SuperBowl expectations

The Giants won the #Superbowl. THANK THE FUCKING GOD. Thats what the  Pats get for being CHEATERS. #ramsnation

Best moment of the evening? #CeeLoGreen being a complete fail. #Madge's lip syncing sucked too. #SuperBowl

If the Steelers had played, I would have been more invested #superbowl

Despite the #Giants #Superbowl victory, the winner of the First annual #buttdocfilm #bootybowl is #teamash

The last time the Giants beat the Patriots in the #superbowl was the same year was elected President. A patte

We decided to eat after the #superbowl lol

#Giants upset #Patriots 21-17 to win Super Bowl XLVI - Yoozpaper | Free Online Articles  #superbowl

Teams trailing at halftime in #SuperBowl have lost 34-of-44 times, but 4 of the 10 wins by #Giants, who have traile

That game would have been more interesting if it had actual giants.#superbowl

That #SuperBowl was like an episode of King of the Hill, but with Peggy Hill as the main character.

OK so football isn't for everybody but I think we could all agree on making the Monday after #SuperBowl a holiday. Everyone wins!

#ificantakebackonething it'd be betting the full $200 on the giants winning the #SuperBowl instead of half

#Madonna straight up sucks. Doesn't matter if she is 22 or 52. She still sucks. #SuperBowl

Don't get the hype for #Superbowl.  How can watchin a bunch of guys on steroids colliding w each other be that exciting??  #NotMyCupOfTea

Good Night Twitter World and Congrats once again to the New York #Giants on winning the #SuperBowl.

See our chocolate footballs? #rollingstone party #superbowl

#Madonna did the show for the publicity. She has no interest in the  #SuperBowl -- only herself.

Congrat to the Giants for winning the #SuperBowl im personally not a fan but they Played A Great Game!!! and Brady can Suck IT!!!!!!!

*No State players were a factor in the making of this Championship.* #Superbowl

Told you   comforts Tom Brady after tough #SuperBowl loss:

Dear You get my pick for #BESTCOMMERCIAL! #donotattempt #kickstartmyheart #SB46 #superbowl  via

Fuck you #ctv for not letting me see the commercials during #Superbowl ! I hate you

#SuperBowl 47 halftime show possibilities: Journey (Yes, Journey!); BuckCherry; Ice T; Pete Best; Neil Sedaka; Miley & Billy Ray duet.

#Superbowl rigged? Super Bowl website showed the giants winning and selling Merch 24hrs before their actual victory. #saywhat?

What a great #superbowl. Thankyou to all our new #teamfollowers and we would personally like to thank for helping us.

And thats all I Have to say bout that #Giants #Superbowl

I guess I didn't miss anything. #superbowl

When's the parade down the Canyon of Heroes for our heroes, the New York Football Giants! #SuperBowl #Giants

I guess #EliManning is going to Disney World tomorrow.  #TomBrady on the other hand will be in a rape crisis center.  #NFL #superbowl

Didn't realise how many Australians were into the #superbowl #backtoworkpeople

I'm just glad someone won the #superbowl I mean seriously is no one else worried about 2012?

Thanks to the giants for making my shirt worth while! #Superbowl #giants

MAKE SURE YOU HASHTAG THE SUPERBOWL WITH SYRIA. IT WILL FORCE PEOPLE TO HEAR OF THIS MASSACRE.#Syria #superbowl

#superbowl these Patriots vs Giants match ups remind me of the late 80's & early 90's Bills vs Cowboys match ups but you knew who was losing

#superbowl Anyone noticed that 9 of 10 sydney trends are S/B related. Time for gridiron to make the big time down under?

As a fan does it really matter as long matter as long as the dont win the #superbowl

Who's goin? New York Giants Super Bowl Victory Parade // Tuesday on Broadway at Battery Place at 11 am #Superbowl

See how the car ads in the 4th quarter of the #SuperBowl fared, including the Cadillac ATS.  ^MLM

I was real excited to watch #TheVoice after the #SuperBowl. After 20 minutes of watching and only 2 contestants picking teams, I got bored.

I def feel sorry for the pockets of those patriot fans though #giantsvspatriots, #giants #patriots #superbowl

On a less signifant note no #superbowl for Brady in peytons house. Love #colts # giants. I'm a happy dude can't u tell Lmao

RT We need 1,000 followers by the end of the year. Great #Superbowl between #giants and #pats! #Valentine day is coming up next!

#Community coming back is so much better than the #SuperBowl.  Can we make it 16 seasons and a movie?

#SuperBowl XLVI  giants did they thing.Eli manning ssay he jus aint da lil bro no more

As much as I love New York (and its Giants), I gotta be honest that this year l'm rooting for.. New England Patriots! #SuperBowl

What was your favorite trailer from tonight's #SuperBowl?

i def texted my pal a pic of my cleavage tonight #superbowl

good times w/ and watching the #Superbowl.  Hey..at least we got this out of it!  #avengers

Sad, while ppl are dying in Syria, ppl here are celebrating #Justice #Syria #Superbowl

Of the 10 currently trending topics in NYC on Twitter, 7 are about #TheVoice and only 2 are about the #SuperBowl.

Is it just me or did the #superbowl creep anyone else out? Greyhound racing, chimp exploitation, pig exploition and sexism.Wow! #notbuyingit

I'm glad that Tom Coughlin is still coaching the Giants, so that there was at least one person on the field older than Madonna. #SuperBowl

The best part about the #SuperBowl was the #Avengers trailer. Just sayin'. (I didn't watch any of the rest of it)

The team I was told to root for won, so I guess that makes it a successful #SuperBowl.

In line to buy my #SuperBowl tickets for next year.

America loves an excuse to get drunk #SuperBowl

Times Square just before #superbowl  started:

Hands down, Chrysler (Clint Eastwood)! It was hard to surpass the Eminem one, but they did it. #ImportedfromDetroit #SuperBowl

They might need to put Wes Welker on suicide watch. #imjussayin #SuperBowl

Record breaking 150K check-ins to #SuperBowl on 3x any other previous event. #SocialTV is definitely a 2012 #s

we drank the Kraftig light during #superbowl I continue to be impressed. It's the new goto beer #bier

My cousin lost the #superbowl bet now he gotta shave his eyebrows off ctfu

Thanks to I spent #SuperBowl Sunday playing in #makeup

The #SuperBowl went how i knew it would ! GIANTS kicking them sorry Patriots Butt ! Brady just need to go home & crawl under his bed & cry !

Will NYC be shutdown tmrw to celebrate #Giants victory? #superbowl

union county isnt so bad :) #superbowl

After going to a million baseball games I can tell you that every sports fan from New York and Boston is a retarded cocksucker. #superbowl

FELICIDADES A LOS NEW YORK GIANTS POR GANAR EL #SuperBowl !!!

Madona killed the half time show at the #SuperBowl

Congratulations New York Giants! Awesome #SuperBowl

I believe someday, someway, the #Bills will make it to the #superbowl#nfl and actually win.

G*Nite peeps. Great night thanks to #Giants #Superbowl Sleep tightBeautiful nightmares

I'm already having cool commercial withdrawals. #SuperBowl Time to go back to the crapfest of normal #TV commercials.

Dear #geico you have disappointed a lot of Covina residents!!!! Goodnight!!! #Superbowl

I took a nap during the #Superbowl so I could stay awake to watch #thevoice and now to bed for my 10 hour work day in retail hell

Wanna say congratulations to the Boothe family for another Super Bowl win! Way to go Kevin!  Your dad would be proud! #Superbowl!

MT Did you miss #Madonna's #Superbowl show, watch it here:  #MIAUniverse

Next year, I want Triangle Sally to be the Super Bowl Halftime headliner. #SuperBowl #halftime

Your #SuperBowl MVP Eli Manning joins Dave to talk about his win over the #Patriots Monday on the #Giants

Manning got a new Corvette for winning the MVP of the #Superbowl. Isn't being new king of NYC enough? He gets a new car to pick up chicks??

Muy buena Noche, Full Deporte!! Congrat a NY Giants #SuperBowl XLVI

The #SuperBowl was good tho. I had a pretty good weekend I must say. Now #backtoreality

I was pretty excited about #Superbowl commercials this year!

They made my crappy weekend alittle better 3 #loveyou #nomakeup #superbowl

Wow!  Madonna's performance during #SuperBowl halftime show saw an average of 8,000 Tweets per second fo

Cee-Lo green in those outfits might have made my night #NFL #Superbowl

Adriana Lima may have been the other day but she's all over the #SuperBowl commercials

Madonna got outperformed by those white track suited dancers. They were great. #SuperBowl

Her entire outfit reminded me of Vintage Versace. #90s #style #fashion #madonna #superbowl

Nervous Dad accidentally refers to a home run at a #SuperBowl party, suddenly announces he will be pooping, not crying, for the next 2 hours

Was looking forward to a celebration riot, too bad Patriots didn't pull thru #SuperBowl

Totally missed the #superbowl & totally didn't care. Made a TON of progress on #arkhamcity though! 10 more items to find & campaign is done!

M.I.A. gave the middle finger? I was too excited about Cee Lo wearing Louboutin's. #SuperBowl

after all his hard work it's nice to see David Carr finally get a ring #superbowl #welldeserved

I'm pretty sure #superbowl was Vanilla Ice's nickname for Madonna's V. -- nickkroll

Eli Manning is #Superbowl MVP   RT So the New York Giants won the Super Bowl? They beat the New England Patriots? #t

I tweeted the cancer survivor #Superbowl guy after the game. Did his team win? I do suck a little eh. #goingtosingnow

i thought was gon do more at the #SuperBowl

My favorite ad was the M&Ms one. #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl ads were lousy. Dumb #pepsi spot made no sense. Ferris was edited. Wego was cute, Avengers too short, polar bears lame, Clint odd

There just wasn't enough horrible music, mediocre commercials, and other shameless spectacle. #SuperBowl

Is GoDaddy advertising targeting 13 year old boys? #SuperBowl

Wow! Even the Governor of California showed up at the #Superbowl party!

#superbowl awesome pepsi commercial; where there's pepsi, there's music. NFL Super Bowl 46 Commercials :

Well-called game by officials. Tarentum's Tom Stabile great work as head linesman. Hope to catch up with him tomorrow. #superbowl

2 out of 3 years the #Giants have won the #SuperBowl a Canadian team has won the #StanleyCup (86 MTL, 90 EDM 07 ANA),#Ihopethis yearits3for4

YES! My dad is now one happy man!! #superbowl

Congrats to my friend #TonyUgoh for stellar #Superbowl #win! You deserve it! #intergrity #commitment & follower of #Christ! True #rolemodel

Everybody watching the #SuperBowl and I was stuck writing an amazing mythical world better than PANDORA!! Hahahahaha

So apparently Eli Manning is better than Peyton Manning #SuperBowl

#WARNING: You have another 364 days of me talking about how the #Giants won the #SuperBowl!

Best commercial of the #SuperBowl? or am I just impartial to Mr. Quiggly?

How many margarita would it take to wash it all down?  LOL #SuperBowl

I'm sure the Jags practiced very hard this year, preparing themselves to watch the #SuperBowl

Buddy & Tobby chilling with me while I watched the #SuperBowl

Ohhh, now I remember why I haven't been on twitter today. Immedietly bored by the obsessive #SuperBowl tweets. Can we get over it now?

The NY Giants are always better with a little bit of salsa! Yeah Victor Cruz and the New York Giants! #Giants #superbowl46 #superbowl

In case you missed #Maddona's half time show -  - #superbowl

#XLVI Sweet finish to a great game! #Giants win! #Superbowl two pumping bro!!

Where's Eli MVP? #Tebowie was pretty awesome, but we still want the MVP. #superbowl

So am I the only one who didn't watch #SuperBowl ?

It sucks to work at a pizza place on #SuperBowl Sunday!

No time to tweet tonight. #superbowl. I spent most of my time reading your entertaining tweets.

The #SuperBowl is ova an done now I'm ready for the All-Star Game #NBA

It was funny how numba 44 on NYG jus set down on his touchdown #SuperBowl

Being surprised M.I.A. did something vulgar during the halftime show is like being surprised your new puppy pooped on the carpet. #SuperBowl

I like Clint Eastwood as actor/director, not so much his politics. But Detroit commercial during #SuperBowl was remarkable #inspired

Did you see our commercial on #CTV during the #SuperBowl in AB, SK or BC? What did you think?

Yeah Whoever Made Bets With Me.. Pay The Fuck Up #SuperBowl

Eli sheds Peyton's Lil' bro moniker with another #SuperBowl win. Can't shake Big Bro from Wonder Years title yet.

Watching  until  I fall asleep #Superbowl  highlights!!!

Still weird to think the game winning touchdown in the #Superbowl was allowed intentionally by the opposing team. Doe

Haha. End of the half time show in the #superbowl had me cracking up. So glad I was working instead of watching the game.

I was probably one of the few who wasn't watchin the #SuperBowl I was SLEEP and I only watch the end 2 see the excitement n confetti anyway

Up in an hour for work I'm fucked like #tired #SuperBowl

And my #superbowl Favorite Commercial award goes to(wait for it)

I was definitely not pleased with the commercials for the #superbowl this year.smh

And so begins my stomachs slow revolt due to the mass amounts of #SuperBowl food I ate today. #worthit #NYG #SuperBowlChamps

But Madonna's half-time performance was nice;-) love her #goodmusic #superbowl

The only way I'll watch the #SuperBowl next year is if is the halftime performer! #Maddonna seriously? #eewww

By being a Hoosier, I don't have to be a #Colts fan. I just have to cheer for anyone playing the #Patriots. #Superbowl

In terms of trailers, this year's #SuperBowl was actually a letdown. No big surprises. Only one WOW moment with the #Avengers trailer

I'm sorry though it was a well done commercial #MelanieAmaro still looked like a cow. #SuperBowl #Pepsi

#Madonna and #LMFAO killed it at the #SuperBowl. you got check this crazy performance if you didnt see the superbowl

Looks like Madonna and I have something in common Neither of us have ever sung at the Superbowl #SuperBowl

How to avoid crappy Canadian #superbowl ads and kill time between plays. Lol and I being silly. Typical!

Why does it matter that I prefer the #6nations over the #SuperBowl? I'm a #Wales supporter and I like men in tight shorts without pads.

Wow. Trending now on my Twitter feed? #TheVoice, #SuperBowl and #Schwartz's. I'm nothing if not diverse.

Just caught up with Madonna's performance at #SuperBowl amazing !!!  before I venture to work she still #QueenOfPop xx

$3.5m = 30 sec #SuperBowl ad OR feeding and educating 70,000 kids in underdeveloped nations FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

In honor of the Super Bowl MVP, for the next week we'll refer to our son Elliot as Eli. #superbowl #Giants

Looking for all the #SuperBowl ads? YouTube was thinking about you (but has poor Google Juice - weird)

This how hate speech looks in the 21 century. Racist cliches during #superbowl adds to steer national identity

#superbowl !! #newyorkgiants !! I knew it ! Lol and I'm not even into football like that lol

The Giants won the #SuperBowl, well of course they did, they're giantsright? Oh they're regular sized people! I prefer my version

There were so many #SuperBowl commercials with dogs in them.

Super proud of for their Dannon commercial during the #SuperBowl tonight. Be ready to hear their names a lot more :)

The only thing redeeming about the #Superbowl is seeing sweaty muscly men grab each other. Oh, and the #PuppyBowl

Can anyone tell me how many #SuperBowl Joe Montana lost?!?

Ok #SuperBowl #puppybowl over. Winners: Giants, Madonna, #Avengers Broderick Day Off  Up next: music week!

Didn't know they were showing re-runs of the  #bradybunch from 2008  #GMEN  #superbowl  #CHAMPS

The best #SuperBowl commentary in my feed was from UK people who had no idea what was going on

WHY IS THEE #SUPERBOWL STILL THE #1 TRENDING TOPIC

What a day! Great ending to #superbowl. Wonderful day with friends and family. #blessed

Worst #SuperBowl commentary was from UK people who didn't understand the game so just took cheap shots at America/Americans instead

Please feel free to distribute for education purposes. #handegg #Superbowl #notfootball #footballisplayedwiththefoot http

I just saw a bit of the #Madonna #superbowl performance, I thought is looked rediculous.I think she shouldn't (cont)

Glad to see #Madonna knows her limitations - #SuperBowl would have been a disaster if she sang live

The #SuperBowl was great. My favorite part was when I ate some chicken wings and then passed out on the floor.

Woke up now!!! I watched 1st quarter of the #superbowl though!!! New york giants won!! #elimanning

Good sporting weekend! Giants win #superbowl and howard webb signs for man utd

Congrats to the #NYGiants on their #SuperBowl win! What were some of your favorite commercials from tonights game?

#America: #SuperBowl for the day, country music for the night, but opportunities for a lifetime

Just finished writing up a #Smash recap. Why, what do YOU do after the #SuperBowl?!  #amwriting er.. #waswriting

lol so im guessing you watched the #SuperBowl? Intense game eh?

Eli Manning, #Giants beat #Patriots to win #SuperBowl XLVI

Good night giant won #superbowl and I finished my homework before 5am #college

Good Morning! I'm back on air until 10. Join me for a #superbowl - ful of 80s tunes ;-)

This superbowl was possibly the most fun I've ever had. Albeit a little too intense. Indianapolis did it right. #superbowl #bucketlist

Well Done Giants #SuperBowl, now off to work :(

Nice and simple site to track the buzz:  All #SuperBowl ads scored by tweets and sentiments. Dori

LOL NBC had to apologise for #MIA flipping the finger during the #superbowl halftime performance. Its not even that big of a deal mayns!

I'm #English. Why would I care about the #Superbowl or anything to do with the #American #NFL? MOST BORING SPORT EVER.

Not looking forward to watching Tree of Life as part of losing my #SuperBowl bet. Thanks New England.

Superbowl ads: never a Seinfeld superfan but this is hilarious:  (car's not bad either)  #superbowl #superbowlads

Funny how #superbowl is trending in India. Must be because when u say Giants & Patriots in one sentence, we think they're talking about us.

i think that after the #superbowl today social media showed its value to any potential investors #twitter #facebook #myspace #linkedin

Woke up to see the have won the #SuperBowl quality stuff from #Eli

Watching Madonna's AMAZING #Superbowl performance. It's a shame she didn't sing. She is supposed to be a SINGER!

Well done to the giants! Wooo! NY 3 #superbowl ! :-D

What is that #superbowl everybody's talking about? Is it a missing artefact that hold the secret of the ultimate fruit salad?

Crap, 7 months to go before the next American Football season starts #Superbowl

#Madonna KILLED it at the #SUPERBOWL last night. She rocks. Unbelievable.

the #superbowl wasnt all that! Kids at my school purposly Missed school just to watch that game! i needed to get an education

Got to pig out and a Happy birthday to Sapphire Miranda. Hum.she made my night? :) #SuperBowl #Giants

#Twitter tells me that I wasn't alone in thinking this years #SuperBowl was #lame

I love watching Tom Brady and the Pats lose! 0-2 since spy gate.. That's not mean, its a fact! #superbowl

How sensational was Madonna at #Superbowl? She has still got it! Love the look too, a killer blow dry!

I bet Tom Brady hates Eli Manning. Seriously tho he's been beat by Eli in 2 #superbowl

Yeah, the #SuperBowl was cool, but the real fun was after the game! #Blue2onLateNight #Social46

#SuperBowl was epic last night. Sadly I stayed up to 4 in the morning to see it

The self-referential Star Wars ending of the #VW #Superbowl ad is wasteful (damaging, even) advertising agency vanity.

Hate to say it but ya boy #EliManning is a #HOF QB and in the top 3 playing right now. Man my balls hurt for typing that. #SuperBowl

Fave #superbowl commercial was definitely the Greek yogurt one! Loved the M&M and Budlight ones though too!

Looks like the #Patriots need to draft so they can catch Hail Marys and win the #Superbowl

Just watched Madonna's #SuperBowl performance I guess Elton John was right.

Well that's me just watching the #Superbowl thankful for #sky+!

She's back. Full force. Like no other! Wow. Wow. Wow.  #Madonna #SuperBowl

Make This #SuperBowl Extra Super with a Brand New #Recliner from Wholesale #Furniture Brokers!  v

#BBCSuperBowl should make an exception and allow #SuperBowl adverts to be shown on-air, as they are usually some of the best ever!!!

Really thought the patriots would win #superbowl

breaks in play apparently brought in to show comercials.#americanfootball #superbowl, hope goal line tech in uk soccer doesn't entice same.

Anna Wintour must have been very satisfied with Madonna's choice of an opening number at the #superbowl Halftime show

Instant Replay: See All the #SuperBowl Spots Again and Again  - via / #Advertising

Giants win! Am sure it's because you dared to wear your shirt in the plane! Awesome #SuperBowl

Loved seeing you on the #Superbowl. I'd say the GoPro spot had as much lasting impact + brand recall as any big $ ad. #brandbowl

Waking up 2 see #superbowl tweets on ma TL,d only thing u lot kno is #touchdown n nothing more.bladdy famzers

#Superbowl #Giants How can you be world champions of something that is only played in America?

American Football ain't nothing like rugby. Rules are completely different. And the game as well. American Football 10x better #SuperBowl

After a game of great defence why would the Patriots let the Giants score a TD with 50 seconds left #superbowl #ijustdontunderstand

It doesn't matter what hotel you stay at if you're up all night thinking about almost winning the #SuperBowl #BradyonBuffalo

So I definitely thought the superbowl was rounders, or baseball or whatever they call it Apparently not #fail #stupidgirl #superbowl

The highest Tweets per sec #SuperBowl peak came at the end of the game: 12,233. 2nd highest was during Madonna's perf: 10,245 via

So far I'm up and feeling pretty peppy, hopefully I can sustain this. Thanks to & for the super fun #Superbowl party

#Madonna #HalfTime #SUPERBOWL   I've seen it now, legendary! She's truly amazing! Loved to see LMFAO too!!

I wonder what percentage gay the #superbowl audience was? Surely they heard the call of their leader.

#Superbowl Summary: Did you manage to catch the ball? Time to show off. Tackled someone? Show off. Successfully kicked

It's been a great day.  #Giants take down #Pats for the second time in #SuperBowl and CD release show!

Wow today is a slow news day. I never quite get why a bit of snow and ice gets a full paper dedicated to it! And no mention of #superbowl

Super Bowl Sunday QR Code -  #qrcode #superbowl

Dont like #superbowl don't understand the H/T entertainment bring advertised as much as the game itself. Jedward at Lords during tea in UK?

Sat up and watched the #superbowl last night. Was brilliant. woke up for Madonna anyway

Good morning #sneakerholics congratulations Giants fans for your #SuperBowl win. Who was up late enjoying the game

What did you think of Elton John's Pepsi ad with US X Factor winner Melanie Amaro during the #superbowl?

There were 10,000 tweets per second, in the last 3 minutes of the #SuperBowl #GIANTS

Best #Superbowl commercial was Apples award ceremony spot, where all Giants were taking pics of the Lombardi trophy with their iPhones.

To be honest, I don't even know who won the #superbowl, but apparently #Madonna either rocked it, or effed up. That's what I've garnered.

20% of employees call in sick the following day after the #SuperBowl I'd call in sick due to being depressed #patriotsforthewin ..next year
