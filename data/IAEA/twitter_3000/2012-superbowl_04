#SuperBowl #commercial Go sketchers! That moon walkin dog was so damn cute!

These commercials keep getting better and better.. #SuperBowl

Let Dan talk more. In fact, forget the game and let's just watch Dan #superbowl

Carsdotcom-Creepy and kinda stupid. But I watched it. #superbowl

Why is the #SuperBowl App for iPad only available vertically and not horozontally. Good Apps turn. Is NBC responsible?

just WON my vote for the fabulous #FrenchBulldog #ILOVEIT #SuperbowlAds #Superbowl #FOJ

AW! I loved that sketchers commercial!!! Bulldog won the race! Ahahahaha(;#superbowl commercials!3

This should be the time to slam dunk an ad.  Somehow all the ones I've seen have been really dull. #superbowl

I'm watching that again. I have to. In 1080p. Dear god. #Superbowl #Avengers

If you give a girl flowers  You will get in their pants Nope! #superbowl

Loved seeing more Hulk in the Avengers #SuperBowl trailer! But Caps outfit looks cheesy

Just added the full John Carter #SuperBowl trailer:

Decent game so far. Giants doing well on defense. Also helps that the pats offense is not really there. #SB46 #SuperBowl #NYG

YOU SUNK MY MOVIE FRANCHISE! #Battleship #SuperBowl

Did the cars.com people actually pay to have that made, or was it forced on them as some kinda court settlement? #SuperBowl

I've had more yards rushing to get more food and booze than the Patriots have had in this game. #superbowl

The #superbowl commercials pretty much suck this year. I've only seen 2 that were ok.

These #superbowl commercials leave much to be desired. If i see one more polar bear tonight

Game is kinda weak this year. Commercials are even worse. #superbowl

watch Schwarzenegger going HAM in these commercials from Japan. Why can't #SuperBowl ads be like these?

all hands on deck don't they play with their shoulder pads? #superbowl

I was on cars.com today.. My confidence hasn't came out yet. #SuperBowl

Come on Madonna! Show the world who the Queen is!!!!!!!!!! #superbowl

Dogs in ads work! Sketchers #SuperBowl spot caught my attention. #advertising

Why do advertisers think having African Americans singing and dancing in commercials still appeal to us. #superbowl #epicfailcars.com

Best #Superbowl commercials so far? HOTHOTHOT David Beckham and the Avengers trailer 3

Does anyone else feel jilted when you see a commercial you've seen before during the #SuperBowl? They need to have #allnew stuff

Yeah, baby I want that car.. Woo.. LOL #superbowl #cars.com

hey I finally found a working #superbowl stream at  Time to drink! RT this please!

Right now there waking Madonna up from her nap. #SuperBowl

Six Samuel Adams deep and a dozen wings at half got to love the #superbowl

I'm just here really waiting on the funny commercials #superbowl

Some game keeps interrupting my commercials. #superbowl?

Giants have the edge but a pretty slow first half so far #superbowl

So far I like #BestBuy & the one w the Cheetah. #commercial #Superbowl #sb46

My #superbowl party had one of these. So: you lose.

Good luck going to the bathroom if you've got a good spot on the couch. #superbowl

Dr Seuss The Lorax Super Bowl Trailer   #superbowl

This is the worst #SuperBowl an Eagles fan like me can imagine, short of a Cowboys-Patriots Super Bowl.  I wish they could both lose.

Don't really get American football but it's nice to see some fat fuckers making a living out of playing a sport. #superbowl

So me jessi havin' our own #SuperBowl party lol this what we eatn on lmao

Cars.com commercial was just plain creepy #superbowl

My Tumblr dash just went batshit over that Avengers trailer. They are my people. 3 #superbowl

I really have to pee but I'm too invested in my TV right now.  #SuperBowl #TMI

The breaks during the #superbowl just aren't the same on British tv. Don't get any of the new, expensive adverts like in America

Anyone else watch the #Superbowl just for the commercials?

I'm so glad I live in a time when the best way to combat childhood obesity is by playing a video game. #superbowl

I guarantee those saying they don't like NFL simply just don't understand it! #Superbowl #IgnoranceIsBliss

Epic #Avengers extended trailer. Contest is over. Best commercial of the night.  #adbowl #brandbowl #superbowl

#superbowl Is it me or are these refs a bit flag happy? Or are the Pats just nervous?

It would be great if the Pats could score a TD to close out the first half!! #superbowl

Jason Pierre Paul showed up today!Let's hear it for the Haitian Sensation.#SuperBowl

Watching the #SuperBowl at work. Super slow night

Why not go for it when you're 4 and 1? That's totally what i'd do on NFL Fever so not sure why the same logic doesn't apply here. #superbowl

I think needs a little brother. And we will call him Bruce #batman #frenchbulldog #Superbowl

Lying in bed in Shields watching #Superbowl not knowing what's going on either

A great Super Bowl Ad: Free to Pee - TaxACT Super Commercial  #superbowl

I don't even know who is the super bowl #idgaf about the #SuperBowl this year #workingatDQ

Brian when I'm out on my delivery I'm gonna deliver 5 or 6 letters then take a break then deliver a few more lol! #superbowl shite

The only way the halftime show will be good is if Madonna's penis accidentally slips out. #SuperBowl

Go Brady. Move those chains#superbowl

They need to run several half-time shows concurrently, and let us use our remote to decide which one we watch. #Superbowl #Halftime #Madonna

So yeah, the #SuperBowl To be honest, I only watch it for the commercials.

Finally Brady playing right. I like it! #SuperBowl

So far only had a good #SuperBowl worthy commercial. #lame

Quiche Lorraine (bacon & swiss) is unique food for the #SuperBowl but it is perfect finger food! #foodie #tailgate

If I yell loud enough at the tv, the football players can hear me #superbowl

Homemade pizzas courtesy of Elise's mom, good friends, and commercials #winning #SuperBowl

Seems like commercials so far are based on beer, food, dogs, cars and especially attractive sexy women. Yup #America #SuperBowl

Maybe american football will send me alseep!! I don't get it at all! Looks like men in fat suits running. Booooring #superbowl

2012 Super Bowl Butt Exercises for Men and Women alike! #workout #SuperBowl

Enjoying #superbowl this year, have to admit I'm quite looking forward to Madonna! Wish we had all the cool ads in the Uk though

I like how every once in a while they going flying off the pitch #Superbowl

I'm more interested in the commercials than the game this year. It's cause I hate both teams. #SuperBowl

Though due to a bet I am apparently pulling for the Patriots, I still love the Giants and Eli!! #Superbowl

flying through the first half so Madonna is going to sing all 12 albums back to back. #SuperBowl

I can't wait until I get to fast forward through the half time show #superbowl.

Brady is good, game is pretty fair now#superbowl

haha :P Not healthy! We're gonna be so tired in history all to watch #superbowl and #americanads :L

Ok, my #superbowl is over. This won. I'm even more amped now. #Avengers Marvel's The Avengers -

Sorry america I tried, I just don't get nfl! It's not football, you don't use your feet enough and that's not a ball!! #Superbowl

Best part is hoping to win in the football pool #superbowl I 3 money!

Almost time for the halftime show. Come on Pats! Lets score one before the half #SuperBowl

hahahaaa, you dont even know what the superbowl is, how can you be supporting NYG?:P #superbowl

I have spent the last half an hour watching the #superbowl and still have no idea how to play it #confusingsport

I can't even watch this anymore my poor nails. #superbowl

WTF!? I'm the only one watching the #SuperBowl where did my cousins go!? Lol #Loner

I'm thinking I've got the best seat in the house. #SuperBowl #man-cave

I'm feeling an affinity towards the Patriots. Just because they're losing and I love an underdog #superbowl

Its really funny seeing nigerian dads watching the #superbowl #TeamNaija #TeamNigeria #TeamNigerian

Right, let's see if I've got this right. Does the winner of the #superbowl get a shot at CM Punk for the WWE title at Wre

From the sound of it, nobody really gives a fuck about this #SuperBowl.. I'm watching cuz I got money on it

Sterling Moore? I prefer Sterling Morrison. #SuperBowl #IWillGladlyMakeOutWithAnyoneWhoGetsThatJoke

Stop. Start. Stop. Start Live Hockey on the Red Button is growing increasingly more appealing. #SuperBowl.

Hernandez is swaggin right now, they need to feed him the ball! #Patriots #Giants #SuperBowl #SB46

You'd think the #Giants & #Patriots organization would be worried that Madonna will contaminate the field. #SuperBowl #NFL

#SuperBowl fact. Tom Brady is a cyborg sent from the future

I get nervous before our FX shows. Can't imagine how the halftime performers must feel right now. #superbowl.

All these Doritos commercials are fan made.#Doritos #SuperBowl

Kozhi kurudairukkanradhu mukyama: I don't think the half-time entertainer shud ever be older than the #Superbowl itself. Sorry

That one football player is weating a Shredder-inspired facemask.  #TMNT #superbowl

So we're gonna try the GI Joe thing again huh? With The Rock and Bruce Willis? Yeah. #Superbowl

Bored during the #superbowl? Browse the weird news on

Indianapolis taxpayers won't finish paying off debt from the Colts' old stadium until 2021:  #SuperBowl #SuperBust

Yay GI Joe 2!! Can't wait to see it! #superbowl #GIJoe2

One thing the #Superbowl proves is how crappy the American film industry has become.

#bbcsuperbowl ok american football I'm hooked and no matter the outcome of tonight's #superbowl I'm now a #patriot forever lol

A very uneventful second quarter it seems I'm a novice to this though Hey I'm from the UK. #Superbowl

Sometimes I get the feeling advertisers are socially profiling the viewers. Just a feeling. #superbowl

I reckon I'll lose interest in the #SuperBowl when Madonna starts singing #oldtart

I love the e-trade baby #SuperBowl

Eurhhhh anyone sat there complaining about the watching the #superbowl on BBC! Noone is holding a gun to your head! Go to bed!

I know of at least 2 former #FresnoState players playing in the #SuperBowl today. Bear Pascoe (Giants) Logan Mankins (Patriots)

#superbowl the rock and Bruce Willis New gi Joe movie!!!????!! Can we say awesome!

I liked the #Teleflora spot. Important reminder for the guys. Thank you Adriana. #SuperBowl

or it is that you could use sky after 11pm as it will waste the electricity bill? #Superbowl

Dear Hubby, save money on #teleflora flowers. I want chocolate or a power tool! #superbowl #commercial

Hard to believe that it's almost halftime already! What do you think of the game so far? #SuperBowl #SB46

Do people have a referee fetish? #masc #SuperBowl

I thought Bait and Switch was illegal in Canada #crtc but i pay #shaw for NBC-hd and get Switched to CTV-hd for #superbowl #fail

I miss turning to MTV at halftime and watching Celebrity Deathmatch #SuperBowl

Has great #superbowl recipes including #tombrady cocktail or Hail #Manning Mary plus gr8 food check out h

I don't think the half-time entertainer should ever be older than the #Superbowl itself. Sorry.  I concur

JPP Stepping Up!! What a Tackle!!! #SuperBowl #SB46

Teleflora scores a TD with Adriana Lima. #YoAdriana #SuperBowl

And the grunts of men and women alike echo through the neighborhood.  #SuperBowl

Just don't make a touchdown#superbowl C'mon DEFENCE!!!!

Just noticed he got 2k tweets from tweeting and retweeting about the #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl linebackers the size of Europe holding tight the line of scrimmage.

Is Danny Woodhead really playing right now? #wheresbenjarvis #superbowl

should perform in the  #superbowl. RT if u agree

Every year I forget how boring #superbowl is. Give me a bit of magic any day!

No #SuperBowl for me. Work work work. I'm only interested in the ads anyways.

Watching the game with the fam Good way to spend a Sunday afternoon. #SuperBowl

so many #hashtags this #SuperBowl, both in the game and in the #ads, as punctuated by the tackle from none other than #JPP

Jason Pierre-Paul best on the field so far  gun #SB46 #SuperBowl

E*Trade ads had become somewhat stale in recent months, but taking the baby away from the computer proves hilarious. #SuperBowl #BrandBowl

#Superbowl - love love that #sketchers commercial. That # bulldog is soooo. cute :-)

Its almost time for Madonna, saw her show in Brazil 2008, she was on drugs #superbowl

The commentators sound as robotic and lifeless as they do in the Madden games, #Superbowl

I cannot concentrate on the #SuperBowl. I'm way to excited to go see #FallonLiveAfterShow

Great drive by the Pats, and they score a touchdown! #NFL #Superbowl #SBXLVI

I dislike football, and I hate the patriots sonah fuck the giants too #SuperBowl #lame

Niki & I are cross-stitching little pink and green whales while watching the #SuperBowl. #truestory

As soon as #madonna comes on, i'm going to go get more #redbull for my #vodka #NFL #Superbowl

I see they name some plays after former players. I wonder what the O.J. entails? #superbowl

BREAKING: Mitt Romney just fired all the #GoDaddy ad execs.#SuperBowl #SB46

[Insert periodic exasperation at the irony of the #athleticbuttpatt in a culture of homophobia here.] #superbowl

My bets for today's #SuperBowl: Ireland will win, but Krum will catch the snitch.

The reason #SuperBowl is on for so long is because they have an ad break every ten minutes haha

#superbowl  can you fastforward the game to get to the commericals??

Me and Justin are both for the Patriots. It's meant to be. #Superbowl

Jason Pierre Paul is a shoe-in for MVP at this rate #SuperBowl

both pretty funny so far #doritos #superbowl

Great stuff from the Pats. Massive 2nd quarter. #superbowl

Tom Brady acordou. #gopatriots #superbowl #nflnaespn 10x9 Patriots.

watching #SuperBowl with my honey!  Loving the commercials!

Watching the superbowl. No idea who is who, who should win or what's going on but I enjoy being part of American culture! #superbowl

damn and the Pats get it back after the half#Superbowl

I prefer college football over NFL! #Superbowl

Nina likes the m&m 1 as well #superbowl

At the bar watchin the #superbowl like I fuck wit football for real

we CANNOT give brady that much time #takeuruggbootsandgohomebrady #superbowl #pix11news

Brady had time to pick his nose, eat it and dig for more on that one. #superbowl #fb

No worries, there's still enough time! #TeamGiants #superbowl

#SuperBowl looks like holding on pats but no call.

Can't sleep! what you guys doing? #wideawake sick of hearing about the fucked up Superbowl #Superbowl

It took him a little while, but Brady scores again. #SuperBowl

OH HELLZ YES!!!! TOUCHDOWN PATRIOTS #superbowl

Now that's what I'm talking bout. Boom. #superbowl

We finally have a game people. #superbowl

Great drive by Patriots and Tom Brady. #Superbowl

YES!!!!!! TOUCHDOWN! !!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!! #LETSGOPATRIOTS #SUPERBOWL What a way to go to Halftime!!! 10-9!!!!

That's all I'm waiting for! Great game though.  #Madonna #superbowl

Is it bad that I'm watching the #superbowl & don't have a clue what's going on? Just randomly shouting touchdown on Skype now!!

Does anyone know if Madonna has recovered from that condition where you wake up with a new foreign accent yet? #superbowl

Really don't care about the #Superbowl  and the #superbowlcommercials suck. #badmood

Yayyy halftime the best part next to the commercials of the.#superbowl

That was poor!!! Giants left Brady open!! What are they playing at? #superbowl #bbcsuperbowl

#Superbowl finally taking off. Some good play. Give the ball to the midget toss the midget into the end zone. Classic play.

TOUCHDOWN??? TOUCHDOWN! HA! I KNEW WHAT THAT WAS! i'm more excited about knowing what that was than anything else. YAY ME!! #superbowl

Dear mr.fry I wasn't txting the ladies. I tweeting the boys#SuperBowl

Touchdown Patriots.. Now we have a #Superbowl

Not watching the #Superbowl. I'm such a rebel (except for the fact that I'll watch the commercials online tomorrow).

I think you may be a little excited about this? ;) #Superbowl

which gives you more excitement #superbowl or F1??

Tom Brady just dealt with the giants then. #SuperBowl

This half has gone AWFULLY fast #superbowl

Chris Colinsworth really wants Brady's nuts #superbowl

Is anybody surprised Brady got that drive done? #SuperBowl

LOVE the #EltonJohn #pepsi commercial. So funny! #Superbowl's ads are the best.

Patriots go on a huge drive-Brady to Woodhead has New England up 10-9 against Giants in #superbowl

I think I can hear cheering #superbowl

Patriots take 10-9 lead with longest super bowl drive in history. #NFL #superbowl

#Superbowl What they should do now is make Justin Beiber and 1 Direction play the rest of the game without suits of armour on.

Tom Brady is a boss, come on New England Patriots!! #superbowl

Allez les Giants! In Giants we trust! #superbowl

#SuperBowl ads mostly disappointing M&Ms the only decent one so far

Cox #FAIL! Cable has gone down 3 times in the first half of #SuperBowl

the amount of time Brady had to throw was unreal! #SuperBowl

Sometimes I terribly miss my life in New York #newyork #superbowl

but a very handsome beast! Go Pats! #SuperBowl

Patriots lead Giants 10-9. Madonna up next. Fingers crossed another David Beckham underoos sighting in the near future. #SuperBowl #SB46

have the new pussycat dolls been revealed !? #SuperBowl

My mom is so pumped for Madonna #superbowl #halftimeshow

Do you actually understand how it works? #Superbowl

Oops!    NYG  9 - NEP 10   headed into the Half.   #SuperBowl

Wish I live in America right now,although I know nothing about #SuperBowl but it sounds like a great excuse to throw a party!

Come on Giants !Please don't let the patriots beat you guys ! #Superbowl

Jean pierre Paul is class. But he can't do it everytime as the #patriots get a hard earned touchdown and lead before the half #SuperBowl

Brady had all day to throw that pass#superbowl

Hmmm.  Wonder if I better watch the first before watching Retaliation?  JK.  #Superbowl

It seems that almost everyone around the world are watching #SuperBowl

Look what I came across on the internet, seems like someone's snack for the #SuperBowl

Awww You don't wanna watch? Or can't? It's like a national holiday No homework!! #SuperBowl ;)

If the money is rite Everything is on sale'Don't madonna hear you say that. #SuperBowl

Danny Woodhead caught a TD pass from Brady to take the lead.  Of course, Woodhead is a former #Jet.  :(  #superbowl

That TD is on the Giants D, no pressure in the first half. that needs to change now!  #SuperBowl

should never be called soccer Im neutral on this one though packers fan but id put pats favourites at this stage #superbowl

Let me try that again. Now that's how you end a quarter. #superbowl #patriots

OK your predictions: What will #Madonna sing? #superbowl

First New England TD makes it Patriots 10, Giants 9. #SuperBowl

IDC Who Wins.. I Came For The Food And DrinkZ!! #SuperBowl

If you're gonna spend P&A money on a #Superbowl commercial you better make GOOD on it #MARVEL #AVENGERS!!!!!

One of the Patriots players reminds me of Fatman Scoop. #SuperBowl

Watching the #SuperBowl but I don't really care about the outcome. Still love me some football!

Cant believe the pats just brought it back like that! #Superbowl

Awwww yeah. That's how to go into halftime. #superbowl #gopats

And. Why is it called a touch down if you don't actually have to touch down?? #SuperBowl maybe or will know?

Practicing American culture on New Zealand's national day #SuperBowl

So excited for Madonna! #Superbowl me too!

Bit of a suckerpunch, Giants have been the better team 1st half but trail at half time, Brady is starting to find his rhythm!! #superbowl

It is #SuperBowl halftime, what did you think was the best and worst commercial so far? How about movies?

Brady to Woodhead TOUCHDOWN 10-9 Patriots, dreadful 1st half and still winning, #superbowl

What a drive!!! big second half come up! #SuperBowl #Patriots #PatsXLVI

Currently Telaflora ad reps are contacting Woodhead's agents about a #SuperBowl ad for next year. #SuperAds

Wow, Pats take lead at half, 10-9. 96-yard drive ties for longest in #SuperBowl history - great game!

And that is Tom fucking Brady!!! AH-MAZING! #patriots. #superbowl.

longest drive in #superbowl history. 98 yards right?

Hey everybody #superbowl halftime is a great time for the kids to play Cocoa Loco from the Toledo Zoo!  #fb

What a drive from Brady and the pats, after the first few minutes its been an amazing half! #Superbowl

Winning at half-time is a good sign! #Patriots #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl advertisers: For these, you paid $3.5 million? Nothing exceptional in first half ads.

Dannie Woodhead 5 foot 9, Wes Welker 5 foot 9 No team has better production by two 5 foot 9 players #SuperBowl

Nice pass/throw .Tom Brady.touchdown..#superbowl

NYG 9 vs NE 10 (middle time) #superbowl #NFL

My timeline is full of tweets about the #superbowl think its my time to sleep- its almost 1am in england. #CYAWORLD

Can not wait for Madonna! #SuperBowl  half time party time! Something old something new. #music

You know what time it is now? L-U-V MADONNA. #superbowl

#Madonna is getting ready to show how it's done. #SuperBowl

First half of #superbowl over Giants 9 - 10 Patriots

I'm starting to get nervous for Madonna. I mean, does she realize what she signed up for? #superbowl

entertaining so far now to be unentertained by madonna #superbowl #nfl #patriots #giants

Madonna. Or as she's known in my book, Oldfrapp #superbowl

Skipping Madonna and will watch Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet during half #superbowl #PuppyBowl

Ok Madonna. Let's see what you can do. #Superbowl

Brady throws a TD pass to Woodhead! They take a 10-9 lead into halftime. #SuperBowl

Maybe if the #steelers were in the #SuperBowl I'd care a little more. GO GO #COMERCIALS!

Ugh! It is halftime and I am soooo full!!! #superbowl

7 minutes to wait for madonna can't wait lol!! #superbowl

Getting nervous about the game! Let's relax with this #bear #SuperBowl

I could careless who wins this game #SuperBowl

The British radio broadcast & #Twitter better than watching the game #Superbowl

No idea what this #SuperBowl is, but it's not hallf a slow game. Had it on for about 10 mins and think they have only played 10 seconds!

watching #superbowl..ny giants vs new england patriots..england time. :)

Patriots gonna get it back now! #SuperBowl

So its halftime of the #superbowl *changes channel* f Madonna

This #superbowl halftime sponsored by AARPwhoops, I mean I can't wait for Madonna #ugh

Oh hell no I want giants to win #superbowl

#Patriots lead at half 10-9 but #Giants did play a bit better but LETS GO PATS! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlXLVI

Woodley sets the #SuperBowl record for scoring a touchdown with the longest hair.

Patriots all the way. Giants are shit. #SuperBowl

It's amazing how 1million dollars doesn't get you as far that commercial these days #SuperBowl

I love #SuperBowl Sunday. If only I could be cheering for the Packers right now

#SuperBowl half Time, the #Patriots lead 10-9.  Big drive from #Brady!

Opposite momentum going into half than #SuperBowl 42. Giants had huge strip sack, not letting Pats score. This is likely a 14 point play.

#Superbowl oh whats that mother fuckers!!!! Patriots are gunna kill it now!!!

& he got his own song! 'you down wit JPP?!' RT Jason Pierre-Paul is a monster #superbowl hell naw lol

RT They are all running towards the approval of their fathers. #superbowl

Game is great so far if you are a football fan  #SuperBowl

I dont want to watch madonna, i want to watch football, what is this shit? #Superbowl

I can never tell if talking baby commercials are reminding u to smoke a cigarette while pregnant or to use birth control. #superbowl

The next twelve minutes will determine whether I, specifically, think THE #superbowl went well this year. #CORRECTION

I guess this is going to be an 18 heart attack kind of game. #SuperBowl

Clayaiken but after he sings at your place RT  Who would be dream artist to hear perform at the #SuperBowl

CRYING. #Truth  I don't think the half-time entertainer should ever be older than the #Superbowl itself. S

I want a car that reads email! #BMW #superbowl

Remember last year everyone was saying #Superbowl half time shows can't get worse than the Black Eyed Peas? We're about to endure Madonna

That was one hell of a drive! Brady ties for longest drive ever in #superbowl history to end first half ahead.

An impressive TD drive by the Patriots to end the 1st half to take a 10-9 lead. Game looking like it'll be another classic #SuperBowl

Bring Out Madonna!!!!!!!!! ugh the suspense is killing me #SuperBowl i wonder if Nicki is a the 2012 #SuperBowl :p

Way to market to your core audience, NFL.  #Madonna #SuperBowl

Tom Brady sounds like the burley detective of a 70's American cop show. One I'd much rather be watching than this shit actually. #Superbowl

Madonna is going to teach me more about perseverance than any of the football players ever could. #SuperBowl #TheQueen

I don't know what's going on. Has Madonna scored a try yet? #superbowl

Thank god there is a 130 year old cyborg goblin performing at half-time #SuperBowl

Lenny Kravitz is at the #superbowl. I wonder if he'll join Madonna on stage for the half time show?

No one tweeting about the game at all. It's all about the commercials. #SuperBowl

The ONLY thing worse than the Pats scoring is Madonna singing. #SuperBowl

Really tho who in they rite minds wud bet 1500 on the #SUPERBOWL

Hmm Madonna this could go 2 ways!! #SuperBowl

Halftime Giants down by one. Who elected Madge to play the half time show #NotCricket #superbowl #NYG

Am I the only one not excited to see Madonna's halftime show? I'm only watching to see  #Superbowl.

The #AudiS7 commercial was gay! What a car still #superbowl

H&M was the worst ad of the first half w/an Ace Score of 450.  Sorry Becks.  Ouch.  #superbowl

Maddona(nanny pat) doin the half time show! Oh dear!! #superbowl #nfl

Awesome! A tout from #WhiteCollar's Who will win #SuperBowl? TOUT | Life's Moments

If you're watching the #Superbowl you're being hypnotized by corporations

Lol everybody eats wingstop while watchig the #Superbowl

Half time show my favorite part!!!!!!!! :D #SuperBowl #halftime

Are these #SuperBowl commercials actually worth the $4 million some companies paid for them?  RT

What is #Superbowl? Why do people want to watch it enthusiastically? Is it not just American football game?

Just watched the first half of the #Superbowl. Is this really a sport? Spent more time watching adverts and commentators than the game!!!

After the #SuperBowl is done imma go check in the ads through youtube

Coming up rippling biceps, a tight end and a wide receiver. Then when she's finished it's back to #Superbowl #bbcsuperbowl #gohandbuckets

Who is your all time favorite #SuperBowl halftime performer?

Seems like ad spend really is moving online. #BrandBowl? Hah! #SuperBowl

Whoever brought back the GI Joe movie franchise and got the Rock and Bruce Willis involved should be shot. #SuperBowl

I really liked the Doritos commercials an the Sketchers commercials. Basically any commercial with an animal was pretty awesome. #SuperBowl

Madonna is about to perform. Lady Ga-Ga is somewhere curled up in her egg crying.  #SuperBowl

Is everyone prepared for the Madonna halftime show, for better it worse? #SuperBowl

While most watch the #superbowl for the game and commercials I'm watching for production value. Look at that wick

I wish the dolphins were in the #superbowl, then I wouldn't feel so stupid wearing my hat.. oh well:)

If u still have faith in the patriots RT! #Superbowl

watching at home. Might head out later #superbowl

Nah, that Madonna $ has bought her some youth just for the #Superbowl

Hmmm, those Giants look like normal sized humans to me #SuperBowl #AlienOpinion

Thank god for TiVo. Just started watching #SuperBowl

what will #madonna sing? please dont kill american pie  at the #superbowl

Hey Superbowl, another example cause marketing backlash M At $182 each, one $3.5m #sb46 ad would pay for 19230 mammogrms #supercure

Ummmm.. why is Madonna at the #superbowl? She's to old. #SorryThatIsTheTruth

So when is the voice coming on again? #OVERIT #SuperBowl

why do english people watch #superbowl? do we think we are missing something? #LUFC

If you dont like football or the #superbowl you are in the minority and your opinion really doesn't matter#realtalk

Half time & New England Patriots lead the New York Giants by 1point - 10:9 #SUPERBOWL

Kickboxing teacher made hot dogs for us, and I just opened my Monster 3 #Superbowl

The second half, particularly the fourth quarter, will be a contest between rival quarterbacks. Will it be Giants? Patriots?#superbowl

Goddamnit I just remembered that I'm Madonna's special guest #superbowl

OMG. Surprise launch of www.themustachegame.tv at #superbowl halftime! Dreams do come true!

Who came up with the notion that NFL fans are also fans of #Madonna? #superbowl

Anyone watching the game downtown? Where's the party?? #DRAC #cbus #superbowl

Kelly Clarkson crushed the #superbowl anthem but Canada gets her at a casino?

Fuck this the #Superbowl ain't got shit on Wrestlemania #MiamiApril1st

I am about to get SO high right now, in hopes that I forget tomorrow that Madonna ruined the #HalfTimeShow of the #SuperBowl

spends all of its ad dollars on the #SuperBowl. There, I said it #brandbowl

Expectations for Madonna's half-time show: nothing. I'm open to being blown away, but I don't expect it. #SuperBowl

#Madonna!!!  I can't wait anymore. Let's go #halftime show! #SuperBowl

#superbowl Who proposes to their girl in a Camry? Lame!

This is so not the time for you to be arguing with you ass hole the #superbowl is on #FirstLove

Hoping lights go out in stadium & Schneider shows up to fix them. #SuperBowl #OneDayataTime

I feel sorry for the people watching the #SuperBowl right now. They don't have the option to change the channel during the halftime show.

Remember, no likey, no lighty. Okay, Madonna, light off #Superbowl

gay men dressed as ancient roman/greek soldiers? what could be better? #superbowl

Did Bellichick get to videotape the #Giants DEF as Mr. Cartmenez said on #SouthPark to the students of Jim Garfield HS? #SuperBowl #Patriots

What's up w all these #mutant commercials #Patriots #PATSNATION #superbowl

Of course Madonna has naked men. #Superbowl

Expecting big things for this halftime show. It'd Madge! #SuperBowl #halftime

Who wants to see Madonna in 2012?! But fuck me do the yanks know how to put on a show. #superbowl

Come on boys! Let's knock em dead! #SuperBowl

The Giants are currently going pretty hard. #SuperBowl

Nothing interesting or unique to say, ha. Everyone on Twitter is snatching up all the good stuff #superbowl

Classic comeback kid drive. Tom Brady baby!!! #SuperBowl

Why is Betty White doing the #SuperBowl halftime show?

Madonna time yay! Taken 90min+ to get to halfway mark of #Superbowl cripes, this is way too longare all NFL games like this #bbcSuperbowl

Oh dear god I can see this is gonna sux already! #SuperBowl #halftimeshow

If nothing else Madonna is always entertaining.  except in most of her movies. #SuperBowl

Madonna -- here to remind the world where Lady Gaga got her schtick. #superbowl

Is Jay Leno going to take away Madonna Half time show too? #BrandBowl #Superbowl #sb46

Is it GaGa? Is it Madonna? Is it both? Who can really tell these days! #SuperBowl

Whats the betting that madonna has veins popping out of her arms and her crotch out. Longest 30mins of the night coming up! #superbowl

surely Madonna can't be as bad as the shambolic performance the Black Eyed Peas gave last year #superbowl

H/T In #superbowl time for the gristly old slapper to do her thing. Used to fancy Madge in '88.Looks like now in a wig #shudder

hahaha this halftime show is worse than scientists predicted #superbowl

It's amazing how they construct a stage that large during half time! #SUPERBOWL

Ok I can't make fun of her now. #superbowl

Strike a pose #superbowl Wonder what Elton will think of the lip syncing?

Everyone said Lady Gaga was trying to be Madonna. Looks to me like Madonna is trying to be Gaga. #superbowl

Only cheering for the Giants because they are James' favorite team. #SuperBowl

Madonna sucks. Wake me up when the third quarter starts. #SuperBowl

Ok Madonna..you were a queen back in the 80s and one of my favorite artist #dontmessup #SuperBowl Sunday

I want Patriots to win. I'm not watching, know nothing about Superbowl and I am going to bed! #Superbowl #zzz

I knew Madonna was old.. But I didn't know Ancient Rome old. #superbowl

Woohoo! Madonna time at the #Superbowl halftime show- that is how to make an entrance. Hell yeah!

Gayest half time show ever? #Madonna #SuperBowl

Who is this lady onstage at the Halftime show? I'm not familiar with her.#SuperBowl

whos's this Lady Ga Ga wannabe? Shocking! #Superbowl

Ewwww, I cannot handle Madonna.. Absolutely too much!!!! #Superbowl

madonna's second appearance of the night, first as grandma in the doritos baby slingshot commercial #superbowl

Anyone else thing #superbowl is pretty boring this year.?

I'm scared for this half time show On a good note, these commercials are cracking me up! #superbowl

You're going to kill me (okmoremyphone) w all this tweeting. #chatty #superbowl

vogue!! but what is she doing, lol #superbowl

Sit Grankowski and get on the field if you want to win the #SuperBowl

Was anyone else hoping Madonna fell off that chair? #SuperBowl

is she gonna lip sync the entire performance?? #Madonna #SuperBowl

at least we cant see any skin #SuperBowl

Hmmm. Close game at half time. #superbowl #halftime

I mean, she looks good. #Madonna #superbowl

Madonna is older than the actual #Superbowl. Hmmm.

Will there ever be a #SuperBowl halftime show that will be good in my lifetime?

Madonna is like the Planet Fitness ad. Overplayed and old. #yawn #Superbowl

Ugh. It's like a Lady Gaga copycot. #Madonna #Superbowl

Kick madonna down one of those sparta holes #superbowl

Looks like Madonna is channeling #ladygaga in her #superbowl halftime attire.

If the only reason you tuned in to watch the #SuperBowl tonight is to see Madonna

Ok. Opening with Vogue is a good throw back. #Madonna #superbowl

Go Madonna! Love that she can still rock the song Vogue in a new way. HOT! #superbowl

worst half time show ever, and it just started #Superbowl

#cirocbowl after the #superbowl.. hopefully its a good celebration

I'm afraid Madonna is gonna break a hip on stage.  #halftime #superbowl #madonnaisold

Lols i mean im sure they could have qotten someone else for #superbowl halftime show lols rihanna could done it or jay z and kanye smh

omg i love the shoes that guy was just wearing dancing around #modonna on the half time show of the #SuperBowl

#superbowl that day when everyone tries to act like they're hardcore football fans #lol

When did Madonna become Sonnie and Cher fused as one physical entity with twice the looks and half the talent? #SuperBowl

The Queen of music. What a start..what a stage. #superbowl.

I'm surprised Madonna didn't break her hip there when she attempted to lift her leg. #Superbowl

Madonna still Looks Sweet thou..#superBowl

Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Britney Spears, et al You should be taking notes right now. #SuperBowl #Madonna

I'd love to see Jason Pierre-Paul just blind side Madonna right now! #superbowl

During this halftime show I'm gonna count how many times my dick flinches at Madonna's face. #SuperBowl

Is she singing in her American or Cockney accent tonight?#Madonna #superbowl #shes86youknow

Favorite commercials: Hyundai Rocky Theme Song & Doritos Baby Sling Shot. #SuperBowl

Got seated right away at a popular restaurant #superbowl

I saw that over-the-hill leg extension, Madge. Get it, gurrl. #SuperBowl

haha, Madonna's entrance reminds me of when Homer did the halftime show #superbowl

Strike a pose, there's nothing to it. Rock it, Madge.  #superbowl

I think this is the first half-time show I have ever watched. I am as giddy as a 12 yo girl right now. :) #Superbowl

It's unclear to me why the 2012 #SuperBowl features a song I made up a dance to in the sixth grade. #Iamold #soisthissong

ummm they should have booked u for the halftime show #superbowl

ahhhthe good ol' days of lip-synching return. #superbowl

When's Britney gonna come out and ruin our night? #superbowl

Okay football players..are you VOGUING right now? #SuperBowl

This Madonna halftime show sucks already.  All they need is a mic, a guitar and Tom Petty.  #SuperBowl

This make me wanna change the fucking channel ! #SuperBowl #Giants

By showing up in everyone else's ads, #BudLight proving to be the Nicki Minaj of the #SuperBowl

Bring back Janet Jackson's nipple! #Superbowl #Giants #Pats

Madonna + American Football just doesn't quite seem right. #SuperBowl

WTF Is she doing and WHAT is she wearing#FOOL#MadonnaBowl #superbowl #bbcsuperbowl

Well, my toddler is really digging #Madonna's #HalfTime show at least. #SuperBowl #Giants #Patriots

That awkward moment when I asked if she was gonna watch the #Superbowl . Silly me. #GiantsFTW

The back-flipping guy with the harp? Show-stealing moves! #bbcsuperbowl #superbowl

Man all these gay vogue dudes on here #SuperBowl

I KNEW she was going to start with vogue!!! #Madonna #superbowl

Lip synching should not be allowed for a #Superbowl performance

For somebody who is 105, Madonna is pretty agile #Superbowl

Am I the only one ready for half time 2 end?! This is awful! #NFL #SuperBowl

Are you watching the #superbowl half-time show? Liking Madonna so far?

Also glad they managed to get a 10 year old vocal track for her to lip-sync to. #SuperBowl #Madonna

Why would Madonna let herself get upstaged by Tetris? #Superbowl

Do you think she likes to live in the past much #madonna #superbowl

I was wondering if Madonna's age would effect her lip syncing, glad to see it hasn't. #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow

Vogueing is about as un-masculine as it gets. How many frat boys in the audience put down their brew and vogued? #Superbowl

She cant sing 'music' without ALI G!! He made that video #superbowl

Glee did pretty well to get to do the half time show #SuperbOwl

Am totally loving Madonna's crazy She-Ra outfit at halftime #SuperBowl

Well it's the #Superbowl half time show with #Madonna so in other words it's time for the #toilet

I'm honestly bored of madge's performance #SuperBowl #halftime

#Madonna time!!!!  My reason to watch the #superbowl!  (And the commercials)

So, Pat's are in the lead. Fuck yes. And listened to the 2012 trailer song for that touchdown. #Superbowl

Please fall please fall please fall. #Madonna #superbowl

Way to pull it back together after your slip Madonna!! #SuperBowl

Lombardi trophy for lip synching goes to Madonna #SuperBowl

My wife went to the grocery store to get away from the #SuperBowl - Apparently they were playing it on the speakers. LOL

The back up dancers are so much better than Madonna , #superbowl

Thank God Madonna covered her arms #SuperBowl #halftime

Old ladies shouldn't wear 4 inch heels. #Madonna nearly falls on stage #superbowl

Stuffing my face with kettle corn while I watch #Madonna wiggle & lip-sync about. #superbowl #halftimeshow

Madonna - still part of the counter culture! I'm listening to one of the touchstones of gay club music being sung at the #SuperBowl. Cool!

VOGUING SO HARD IN MY KITCHEN RIGHT NOW #SUPERBOWL

Why ain't my tv on a sepia filter, Madonna's performing! oh wait that ish live?! #Superbowl

Madonna lip syncing like a mother bitch.#Superbowl

No matter what your view is on Madonna, I think we can all agree that we're just happy i's not the Black Eyed Peas. #superbowl

We're loving the #Superbowl halftime show right now. #NoHomoTracks #Madonna

what am I missing in Sheffield?? #Superbowl

Madonna's dancers' jumpsuitsI must get me one. #SuperBowl

I think she's wearing gold David Beckham underpants. #superbowl

Go madonna! Also can the crowd see the animations? #superbowl

This is the worst #superbowl half time ever would be better if it was the cast of Glee, and more relevant

Oh man Madonna almost ate it! #SuperBowl

Lad on the in the #Superbowl looks EXACTLY like someone I know, ahahaha

What the hell did that backup dancer do with his leg?!? #SuperBowl

Could Madonna have any less energy? #SuperBowl #halftimeshow #madonna

I swear a couple of those gladiators looked like The Village People. #superbowl

He looks like a pigeon caught in a telephone wire. #superbowl

Gotta give it up for #madonna. She can still rock. And those guys on stage must be contortionists. #superbowl #halftime

U kno he get it in the butt #superbowl

I'm so glad she has Richard Simmons performing with her. #HalfTime #Superbowl

Man, they gotta stop letting senior citizens perform the halftime show. #superbowl #madonna

the technology in this is trippin. i cant tell what it is in front of the stage.. projectors? #superbowl #halftime

Madonna is THE shit, gotta love her #SuperBowl

o ok that's what's up. Well u I'm from NY so lol yea #Giants #SuperBowl

Madonna had a Rowley moment *studder fall* did anybody hear party rock anthem #superbowl

This is some show - although I'm more interested in the acrobats and dancers than her #Madonna #superbowl

LMFAO? Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. #superbowl

well if this isnt the definition of over produced shit i dont know what is.. #SuperBowl

I'd prefer to see a marching band perform at the #SuperBowl, honestly :P

Geriatric Olympics or Madonna show. You make the call #superbowl

1980 called and they want #madonna back. Oh and england called too, they want her fake accent back as well. #superbowl

Oooh nice mashup there! Party Rock in the hooooouse! #Superbowl

You have to assume either Americans are too stupid to realise she's miming, or that no-one gives a shit. Neither option is good. #superbowl

Yeah lmfao!!! Now this is way better #superbowl #halftimeshow

I didn't know Richard Simmons did tight-rope tricks. #superbowl

What is this mash up.. and why can't she just sing it. #Madonna #superbowl

Why am I sitting here watching a karaoke show? Screw this, I'm cleaning the kitchen #halftime #SuperBowl #fb

Visually, half time shows are just amazing!! #superbowl

Very impressed with the production and stage visuals for #Madonna at the #SuperBowl Shame about the performer

Really madonna yo ass suck like where yo got your dance moves from. And yo ass almost fell.#superbowl smdh

#SuperBowl half time show was MADE!!!! 3 LMFAO 3

Is there anyone else #Not watching the #SuperBowl ? Or am i the only one ? #curious

#superbowl lmfao with madonna r you sure iv seen it all now

This would never happen at a football match half time in England.  #SuperBowl

Madonna is droppin it and doin it in stilletos in her 50's. #Superbowl

Werr2 would had killed the half time show at the #SuperBowl Welcome 2 My House Party would had killed it

Blacked eyed peas look different #superbowl

doesn't appeal to me, I would've preferred #superbowl #halftime

LMFAO madee this so much better #Superbowl

omg - madonnas snatch is in my weave!! #superbowl #lmfao

I Ain't Gon Lie, That Rope Stuff Was Clean !!! #SuperBowl

That Bob Ross dude on the tightrope was pretty impressive #SuperBowl

Shuffling with madge that's pretty sick #lmfao #superbowl

Madge: Sorry to say this, but your #SuperBowl outfit is shite

This Madonna performance is killing me. HAHHAHA (: #superbowl

#superbowl Not that I'm not enjoying it, but a bit of effort in the vocals wouldn't go a miss.

She did the funky chicken! I love Madonna #superbowl

Cool, it's the Furious Five. Where's Grandmaster Flash? #SuperBowl

Madonnas backup dancers are more entertaining than she is #SuperBowl

Seriously, Madonna you're struggling. Let LMFAO show you how it's done. #SuperBowl

I am so fucking confused. #superbowl #halftime #madonna #lmfao #straightfucked

Is that David luiz giving it the beans with Madonna? #superbowl

I love that she is fully dressed! Thanks Madonna for choosing a conservative outfit. #superbowl #halftime

#Madonna is so old she faxed in her application for #Superbowl halftime show headliner.

#superbowl Check out tomorrow's front pages at www.newseum.org

I'm actually looking forward to Madonna's show cuz then there will be someone on the field older than me. #SuperBowl

Lol gwannnnnn madge for a 50 yr old she can move #SuperBowl

How much better were the Black Eyed Peas last year? This is TERRIBLE. #SuperBowl

aerobic Madonna sort of reminding me of Franca Sozanni #halftime #superbowl

First decent #halftime show I've seen for years #superbowl

wow almost had a wardrobe malfunction? #madonna #superbowl

Waitare Cheech & Chong DJs, now?  #Superbowl #Halftimeshow

Watching an old woman try to remain cool #SUPERBOWL

It is proper amazing how they set up the half time show so quickly! #whereisnicki? #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl #MADONNA

That was nice of Richard Simmons to make a cameo at Madonnas #superbowl performance.

MIA looks like she doesn't want to be there #superbowl

Anyone who is enjoying the halftime show needs to be euthanized. #superbowl

LOL these #SuperBowl ads are killing me! Oh Madonna.

#superbowl Halftime Madonna show . OK Music. Good Show. Great Graphics  $&$ Lights

Ever since Janet showed her tits on tv they banned all black ppl from performing at the #SuperBowl

I have no interest in the #superbowl halftime show unless Janet Jackson showing me sumo tities.

Damn Madonna looks like 87she still is not aged #superbowl

LMFAOOO  I don't think the half-time entertainer should ever be older than the #Superbowl itself. S

When did it become acceptable for big artists to mime?! Really shocking! #Madonna #fraud #SuperBowl

Why was Richard simmons doing acrobats while Madonna was singing #superbowl

Madonna you definitely are not sexy and clearly dont know it #Superbowl #halftimeshow

Madonna is so cool. Rocking with LMFAO hard core. #Madonna #SuperBowl

LUV dis woman! No wonder she's my all time fave!!!!!!! #Madonna #superbowl

- so glad I stayed awake now!!!! #superbowl

Alot of stuff going on at same time!  Would have liked for #Madonna to sing LIVE!! #LipSyncFail #SuperBowl!

Madonna hasn't aged in the past 20 years #Jealous #Superbowl

Madonna get off ur knees you are blowing the halftime show #SuperBowl

Must give it to Madonna she knows how to put on a good show #SuperBowl

THAT IS HOW YOU STAY RELEVANT, MADONNA!!!!! #superbowl

Advertising for Vogue and Bridgestone during halftime show #superbowl, did anyone catch that?

50 and shuffling. I see you Madonna. #superbowl

Skipping #SuperBowl halftime. Sorry, material girl!

The Superbowl wouldn't be the same without the funny commercials, especially the Doritos ones. #superbowl

I so expected nicki minaj & M.I.A at the Madonna #SuperBowl performance

Sat on our balcony in Phuket having breakfast and listening to Madonna on at the #SuperBowl!

Watching Madonna. The thigh high boots cover scars from her hip replacement.  #lateshowwriters #superbowl

Sorry we woke you from your nap, Madonna, but it's time to perform. #happened10minutesago #superbowl

That's some top class miming Madonna. #SuperBowl

kudos to madonna for keeping covered and her dance crew in family friendly garb#superbowl

The dude's neck from  #LMFAO smells like sweaty #pussy .  #Madonna  #Superbowl.

(this is how you stay slightly less relevant, madonna) #superbowl

It is brilliant, but she does have the air of an embarrassing mum in the playground. #superbowl

Madonna and Nicki girl should kiss.#SuperBowl

Could Madonna lip sync anymore #brutal #superbowl

Amazing Madonna Go Giants Go New York!! #Superbowl

Seriously stop this Madonna HT show! Can't watch this anymorethis is torture! #Superbowl

That's so mean, but it's so true. #SuperBowl

I mean at least there's music involved in the #superbowl. This is crazy.

Wow, lip-sync much madonna? Not even good at it. No energy. Boring performace! #madonna #superbowl #fail

Madonna obviously has the same doctor as the Queen Mother (had) and Mr Burns #Superbowl

This halftime show couldn't be any worse #superbowl

I'm sorry but the halftime show was the sickest #SuperBowl #madonna #lmafo #Nikki

Nicki Minaj is a baller. 'Nuff said. #SuperBowl

I'm impressed by madonna. I don't think I could do half the things she's doing! #superbowl

Yes. RT was that mick hucknall on the bouncy rope thing? #superbowl

Worst half time show ever #Madonna #SuperBowl put ur rat away

Is this a Spinal Tap influenced half time show? #superbowl

Only good thing about the half-time is nicki minaj #superbowl

She's got arthritis that's why.. #Madonna #superbowl

#SuperBowl Niki Minaj and MIA?  Wow, she's jumping right into 2012.

#MadonnaSuperbowl bedtime. Set to record. Will watch when I have a empty stomach. #Superbowl

I am not subjecting my love bird Lucky to Madonna I refuse he would be horrified.#Madonna #superbowl #BBCSuperBowl

Better lip syncing than Ashlee Simpson #positive #SuperBowl #halftimeshow #halftime

Two other girls on stage and Madonna hasnt made out with them? #halftimeshow #SuperBowl

I wouldn't be upset if someone flew a predator missile into the stage right now #SuperBowl #Madonna #NickiMinaj #PleaseStop

And why are Madonna and the rest of them dressed like Thor's cousins from Asgard? #Superbowl

Next year for the #SuperBowl please have someone RELEVANT perform during halftime

Madonna at #superbowl like watching your Nan at a wedding - some of the worst/best miming ever seen #madonnaincare

I wonder if somebody will throw Madonna hydrangas after she performs? #Superbowl

Worst lip synced halftime show Eva #superbowl

I gotta give it to them, great stage. BUT sorry guys this is B-O-R-I-N-G #Madonna #SuperBowl

Ok nicki killed it. Not sure bout mia. #superbowl.

Madonna: living proof that plastic does deteriorate quickly. #halftime #SuperBowl

This half time show needs hobos, lots and lots of hobos #nfl #superbowl

New theory: American pop music is controlled by a cabal of costume designers. #superbowl

#Madonna works with younger artists to try and stay relevant. It's too bad she's just an old cooze #SuperBowl

Great game so far. Half time show makes me want to kill myself though. #SuperBowl

Madonna isn't singing at all. Makes you wonder if the football is real. #superbowl #Madonna #phoney

That girl doing the half time show at the #superbowl seems to have gone a long way since she played the Hacienda.

#madonna performing #halftimeshow at #superbowl fantastic. Shame f.a cup finals are'nt this fun at half time #bbcsuperbowl

its like botox was given life and dancing boots #superbowl

Who is the other girl across from madonna??? #SUPERBOWL

tell me when lil Kim was at the #superbowl  or waittttt never

Nicki minaj and Mia defintely need to be together more often! #superbowl

Just found out that nicki minaj is a girl honestly thought she was a block. #superbowl  #mybad

I have to say I'm disappointed with 's skirt. I was expecting to see that ass ass ass ass ass ass #superbowl

Ah, she pulled it back with LMFAO, then ruined it with whatever the hell this is now #SUPERBOWL

can we keep everybody BUT madonna #superbowl

&quot Madonna now attempting to shuffle with LMFAO #superbowl&quot; haha what a laugh

C'mon, you've got to admit this was better than that BEP fiasco.  #halftime #Superbowl

LMFAO, Nicki Minaj & MIA alongside Madonnawho would've thought? #SuperBowl

I liked the halftime show this year than last year #superbowl

I'd still take a Faith Hill halftime show over this. #superbowl

The biggest incentive for players to get to the #SuperBowl is that they get to be in the locker rooms so they don't have to watch this shit.

Is this MIA too? Is this a good Superbowl halftime show? #superbowl

Just from the radio, I can tell Nicki Minaj is lip syncing right now #Superbowl

Why is Madonna even bothering to carry a microphone? #superbowl #sb46 #halftime

This #SuperBowl will go down in history as one of the WORST half time performances. She better flash us a nipple or something lmfao

That's not even how you spell love, Madonna. #smh #SuperBowl

Is anyone else bugged that no one is actually singing during halftime? #superbowl

Wow, Lady Gaga looks older every time I see her. #Madonna #superbowl #halftime

#SuperBowl does anyone else notice how Madonna has a mic and a mouthpiece? Fail!!

I don't know what to think of this performanceso overwhelmed! #madonna #SuperBowl

Would love to see this in person, looks fucking epic #Superbowl

that round figure gotta be cee lo loool.!! #superbowl

That's not how you spell 'love'. #superbowl

I feel like I'm now retarded after watching the #SuperBowl #Halftime

But #Madonna is rocking it. Certainly most spectacular #SuperBowl show ever.

MIA just flipped the bird. And they missed the blur sensor by like 5 seconds. Hahaha. Yes. #SuperBowl #halftime

my computer just became sentient so it could stop me from live streaming the halftime show #superbowl #selfpreservationchip #thankshal

Love #madonna at the #superbowl 2012 Still puts on an awesome show!!

I haven't seen this much action during a #superbowl half-time show since oh, my wife just stepped into the room. Never mind.

I love watching a dinosaur lip sync #superbowl  #nextchannel #sarcasm

your girl is ROCKING it out of the park #superbowl

If someone did this on America's Got Talent, they'd be laughed (and buzzed) off stage. Truly diabolical. #Superbowl  Ahaaa

The rope dancer should do next year's #superbowl halftime. He's been the best part of this show so far.

What were they thinking with this half time show? Absolutely awful #superbowl #madonnaisold

Sighsee what happens when Nickelback doesn't play the #superbowl half time show???

Everyone on stage with Madonna should be totally fucking ashamed of themselves #superbowl

#superbowl stat : A-rod has had sex with everyone on stage at the #halftime show

Am I the only 1 liking this halftime show?#Superbowl

Someone at NBC 13 just got fired #SuperBowl

Yes Cee Lo Green! Maybe he'll save this! #Superbowl

Censor fail. Guess we know what's leading the morning shows tomorrow. #SuperBowl #Halftime

Where did the spartan guys go!? I want to see THEM in go-go boots with skirts flipped up. #madonna #superbowl

The stage & dancers are saving this performance from rivaling The Who as the worst SB performance ever #SuperBowl

Lets hope one of those drummers stabs her with their stick!#superbowl

#Superbowl, I think I used to play in that marching band!

SO MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE #SuperBowl halftime show

I think Madonna could've done s better lip syncing job #superbowl

And there's ceelo. This whole affair is very random. #Superbowl

M.I.A just flipped off America. #Superbowl #superfinger

Wtf is Madonna doing in the #superbowl ? Ruined the halftime show fersure

The Half-time Crossbar Challenge at #Scunthorpe is preferable to this Madonna lark #Superbowl

There's some Football game cutting my Madonna concert short!!  #Superbowl

Celo green looks like a clown #superbowl

Well I guess that's the closes we gone get to some Color at the #Superbowl Performance Haha

Why is it that even when Nicki Manaj is fully clothed, it seems like her vagina is showing? #SuperBowl

HOLY SHIT THIS IS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT. #superbowl

Madona horrible halftime pick. that was sad #sheisfifty #superbowl

the #superbowl is da shyt go patriots yea and roman dere on hell yes

Those kids playing I bet are enjoying that! #SuperBowl

Now Cee-lo had 2 be seenwhere is the Goodie-Mob #superbowl

I think this one has a good chance of winning #SuperbOwl

A vaina bueeeena eso de madonna con LMFAO Que perros :D madonna is sexy and she know it.. #Superbowl

Is this what the apocalypse is like when it begins? #superbowl #madonna

Cee-Lolooks like Gus from Cinderella. #superbowl

Waits for *We are the world* oh wrong person. LOL! #SuperBowl

This year - Madonna medley - next year RENT!  #SuperBowl

#Madonna is moving like a 50 year old. I should know.  #SuperBowl

This is actually quite sick. I take it back. #Superbowl

My bitch Nicki was up there Idc bout everybody else #superbowl

Like a prayer I love this song #MadonnaNoEsporteInterativo #SuperBowl

Is the #superbowl the most boring sport ever created??  I'd say its defo on par with darts anyway

Guy Ritchie must be sitting a home thanking his lucky stars. #closeshave #Superbowl #Madonna

Oh look cee-lo greens career is now ruined #SuperBowl

Half time show is amazing. America is cool! #SuperBowl

Madonna is freakin amazing! Lmfao are pure awsome and Nicki Minaj was the cherry on top. Best superbowl halftime! #superbowl

Tim burton after a stroke trying to make ben hur the musical #superbowl #halftime

U kno they also should have Bruno Mars and Beyonce tonight. #SuperBowl

I don't care what she does in her personal lifebecause #Madonna puts on one heck of a #SuperBowl halftime show!!

Madonna featuring the cast of Happy Feet/ March of the Penguins #superbowl

Foo Fighters would be the best halftime show ever at the #SuperBowl. Big, arena-ready, anthemic songs with Dave Grohl as lead singer/emcee.

Why hasn't Madonna learnt how to mime well after all these years?! #Superbowl

I just don't get why Madonna is at the #SuperBowl

Damn Madonna bring everybody out! #SuperBowl

- Did Cee-Lo Barkley Gnarls Green just have a wardrobe malfunction? We nearly saw tit! #SuperBowl  Madonna FTW! Great performance girl!

Marching band was only good part. Wonder who that was. #sb46 #Superbowl #MadonnaSuperbowl

Okthe Like A. Prayer part is kinda cool. #SuperBowl

LMFAO, Cee Lo Green and Minaj on one stage Shudder #SuperBowl

The halftime show is outrageously over the top #bbcsuperbowl #superbowl #ridiculous

I wonder if the energy translates more in person from Madonna's performance than via the boob tube. Seems a little restrained #SuperBowl

Good thing Madonna had people performing with because she has majorly underwhelmed! #SuperBowl

Oh Shit! The black chick from Glee! Nope, it's CeeLo Green.#MadonnaBowl #SuperBowl

Just turned BBC1 on to see wat everyone's on about what aload of old shit lol! Madonna jog on! #Superbowl

wow this #superbowl halftime show is pretty good

Ew If i see one more girl spread their legs on stage.#superbowl

Thought the half time show was Madonna not LMFAO/Madonna/Nicki Minaj/Cee Lo Green?? #superbowl

Madonna without photoshop great show #SuperBowl #Halftime

How much is Hershey paying to have Cee-Lo front and center during this #superbowl extravaganza

I wonder if will incorporate God into any of Madonna's lyrics. Maybe Like a Virgin? Strong abstinence message there. #SuperBowl

I just lost like 30 brain cells watching that halftime show #superbowl

I THINK MADONNA ZIPPED HER HAIR UP IN HER COAT ! #SUPERBOWL

Really wishing for a slow clap at the end of this set #superbowl

I love you babyBut face it she's MadonnaNo man on earthCould say that he don't want her #superbowl  it s like a little prayer

The Black Jesus from the music video has really let himself go  #SuperBowl

Lady Gaga This is how a REAL bitch does it so STOP!!! #SuperBowl

totally insane! // and what about that stage!!???? #MadonnaHalfTime #SuperBowl cc (via

WHY does Cee lo Green always think that wearing a moo-moo covered in sequins is good looking? #Superbowl

Cee lo doesn't look happy being on that podium #superbowl

Holy Madonna!!! This is the best #SuperBowl halftime show in eons!!!

Anyone else have an intense desire to Tebow during Like a Prayer? #superbowl #halftimeshow

madona super mami she rocksss!!! #superbowl

Nicki Minaj? *shoots self twice* yep, twice.still hate this bitch -__- #Superbowl

They should've just married Pac-man and Ms. Pac-man instead. #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow

We're now 40 minutes behind the #SuperBowl and I am wondering if anyone ever figured out how Marko Jaric managed to land Adriana Lima.

now those gladiators could of come to my toga partycan leave Madonna at home! #superbowl

Looks like bussing a super XXXL version of Billie Jean Motown 25 jacket #SuperBowl

M.I.A. Just flipped off the camera #Superbowl #SuperBlah

Cee Lo Green's teeth are a clear highlight here. #superbowl

Springsteen should just be made honorary Superbowl performer every year. Hasn't been good since him. #superbowl #BOSS

This is almost as painful as when the Black Eyed Peas performed. Couldn't they have brought back the Stones or Bruce? #superbowl

Oh dear, at first it looked like Madonna was coming onto the field inside an egg. #superbowl

Wonder if Madonna smells like all old ppl, piss And brut Hahahaha #SuperBowl

Is the choir rejected American Idol ppl? #superbowl

This year, the Super Bowl, next year, Dublin's 4th of July. #wheretheoldiesgo #dublinohio #superbowl

It must suck to be at the #SuperBowl nd be facing the back of the performance

Gosh, all these songs are giving me flashbacks to being very little and my mom dancing around my house to them. XD #halftimeshow #superbowl

True musicianMadonna.can still perform & sound good even if u look #DEAD #Patriots #PATSNATION #superbowl

The adult choir from Christmas in Washington haha lol #superbowl #halftime

Madonna, you might also want to hang up the dance routines in heels, don't want to witness any broken hips.  #SuperBowl

The 50 yard line: where aging gracefully goes to die.  #Superbowl

I was watching the #Superbowl and suddenly Lakewood Church came on

Somebody in the delay booth at the #SuperBowl just lost their job..

Weren't to bad halftime show in the end, only because the lmfao, cee lo and Minaj #superbowl

ive seen more convincing parrots lip sync #Superbowl

The staging, though simple, is incredible. The stadium makes for an amazing backdrop. #SuperbOwl #HalfTime

Now that's what I call a half time #Superbowl

#SuperBowl. Is the third best thing of the new year for me

I think E.T. in a wig did a great job at halftime. #SuperBowl #ReesesPieces

Madonna i'm liking the mash-up. But why does cee-lo look like a big black disco ball with all that sparkle. #superbowl #halftime

Madonna, LMFAO, Cee Lo Green= Awesome Halftime Show!! #SUPERBOWL

Ok, now we are getting into a groove. Love like a prayer performance w #superbowl #madonna

Not sure which would be worse: a Cee Lo Green or Madonna wardrobe malfunction. #superbowl

Nobody can produce a spectacular show like Madonna #Superbowl

Well thank god that's over! #SuperBowl

Did Madonna just get Carouseled? #superbowl

I'm not even lookin at madonna I'm all about ceelo right now! Get ittttttttt #superbowl #halftime

Half Time show was DOPE aint gone lie #SuperBowl

#madonna is the boss. Awesome #superbowl show.  I can hear #GaGa cringing.

I think the graphics and costumes and aerobics in this halftime show is amazing #SuperBowl #halftimeshow #Madonna #rocked #superbowlfun

Keepin it real, this was the best halftime show in a long time #SuperBowl

Did they just shoutout Metta World Peace?lol  #SuperBowl

Nah were was Justin Timberlake 4 minutes lol #Superbowl

Did we just sacrifice Madonna for world peace? #superbowl

Good thing about Domed super bowls? Epic halftime stages #SuperBowl #XLVI #Madonnabowl

And they banished the evil witch to hell.  The end. #superbowl

worst #superbowl half time show. NO TITTIES WERE SHOWN

What the fuck did I just watch #SuperBowl

would tear this crowd a new a$$ if we were all lucky enough to see them play next year's #superbowl #halftime

Madonna sitting on the dude from lmfaos shoulders roflmao his fro looked like her bush #SUPERBOWL

I've had acid trip that made more sense then this #SuperBowl half time show

Like a prayer is good. I'll give her that.. #lipsync #superbowl #cee-lo #madonna

#worldpeace. madonna wtf where did you go? #superbowl

Ok now that's over back to more football #SuperBowl

eh!! #halftime is finally over. now let's get back to the game #superbowl

Imagine this in football (soccer)? You'd have Michael Brown kicking balls of everyone's heads #Superbowl

Halftime show wass crazy. Sooo wish I was therr :( #SuperBowl

Not bad Madonna. My mum certainly couldn't do that. #superbowl #Madonna

Wow, totally impressed by Madonna! She's so amazing #Superbowl #Halftime - we're loving her + Cee Lo Green!

Just got back to the tv. Rev. C.Lo Green, I get. But who put the name of a Laker on the field? LOL! #SuperBowl

That might have been surreal as fuck, but that half time show was actually kinda good. #superbowl #madonna #nickiminaj'sass

A weird Meta World Peace shout out to end halftime Whatever, it's Madonna and she does what she wants. #Superbowl

You know when your aunt gets drunk at the XMas party & starts singing 80s pop? This #Superbowl halftime show is it's popculture equivalent.

Now she's gonna suit up and play wide receiver for the Giants #Madonna #Superbowl

#SuperBowl Madonna Halftime show - somebody threw water on Madonna and she melted! #WizardOfOz

The best part of the #superbowl #halftimeshow was watching #madonna disappear I need some advil to cure this massive headache!! #epicfail

I actually enjoyed Cee Lo. He was the only highlight of the performance. I love his uniqueness. #Superbowl

It would help if maddona would sing in time with the words #superbowl #bbcsuperbowl

You can follow the #SuperBowl Tweet Leaders here:

Shouldve brought out Metta World Peace when the stage had his name on it! #superbowl

As much as it pains me to say it, Madonna put on a show! Wow I'm actually impressed with it all. #SuperBowl

#madonna ruled the #SuperBowl I forgot for a moment we have the rest of a game to play.

That half-time show was actually pretty cool #superbowl

How long ago did Christina film this? 30 pounds ago? #superbowl

#SuperBowl Madonna ends her performance with a shout out to Ron Artest: WORLD PEACE! He must have hit that!

Like a Prayer my song of Madonna.  Amazing show Go Giants!!! #SuperBowl

FARK!!!!!! Madonna that was a BRILLIANT Half Time Show!!!!! #SuperBowl

My favorite part of the show was where Madonna disappeared. #SuperBowl

Technology wise- A+++ Music wise- F+++ #halftime #SuperBowl

Must say that was one of the best halftime shows in a while #Superbowl! #Madonna

could make for a better halftime entertainment #Superbowl

the game has now lost all tension & atmosphere it's like a new game now. #superbowl

She's the greatest one ever! God on heaven and Madonna on earth #SuperBowl

Patty Labelle is going to be pissed once she sees C Lo wearing her dress. #SuperBowl #sb46halftime #sbhalftime

Wow overall I enjoyed the 1/2 time show!  #Superbowl 1st time in a long time!

The reactions at The Fleet to 'World Peace' were insanely funny. Fleet Bowl needs to happen every year!! #SuperBowl

I like this The Voice promo. Love Betty White. #Superbowl

it's a win to have a 53 year-old rocking, on her terms, at the #SuperBowl.

#Madonna was AMAZING! Like a Prayer gave me chills! #superbowl

How did Madonna just go from dropping it low to gospel singing?! #Superbowl

That half time show, blew last years half time show out of the water by miles #SuperBowl

Madonna started rough but finished strong with Cee Lo. #MPSuperAds #superbowl

Heather: That boy singer looks the prettiest because his robe is all glittery. #CeeLoGreen #Superbowl #Halftime

Not a #Madonna fan but that was sensational stuff. An amazing live production. She called the #SuperBowl an almost religious event. Amen.

Seriously Blake Shelton?  Your agent let you get your ass kicked by Adam Levine? #halftime #SuperBowl

#Superbowl Halftime show context: I was 8 and we weren't even $3 trillion in debt when Like a Prayer was a hit. #JustSayin

Christina Aguilara and superbowl commercial is better than Madonna halftime show. #superbowl

Where can I get a pair of Cee Lo,s shoes? #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl  halftime show was AMAZING.Jamming the entire time.

I was waiting for Madonna to bring out Skrillex. #Superbowl

Who is this Madonna everyone is tweeting about? Is she the one President Clinton had the cigar incident with?#SuperBowl

irate that she can't watch modanna on streaming #superbowl

I love this version of vogue by skeletor! #Superbowl #halftime

omg that was an AMAZING half time show!!! all hail the Queen #Madonna ! #superbowl

Boy, Stevie Nicks sure has cleaned up since she kicked the yay! Clear skin, fuller hair- even looks significantly taller! #SuperBowl

Hey #SuperBowl people. Your halftime show sucked.

Madonna and World Peace? What did you guys think of the halftime show?#SuperBowl

Epic staging for the half-time show. #superbowl

Did she just spontaneously combust?? Cool!!! #Madonna #dead? #superbowl #halftime #justinbeibernext??

So take a song that the USA populous disliked for blasphemy and then use it to promote world peace. #Madonnahasb*lls #superbowl

i don't know much about football but Tom Brady's pretty cute and Madonna rocked it! #superbowl #nfl #madonna

#SuperBowl When did Madonna start to resemble Betty White?

Welcome back #Madonna! The world has missed you! #SuperBowl #girlpower

This isnt sport #SuperBowl this is just comercial bullshit who has a half hour HT? No sport does that!

Ce Lo Green has the physique of a circle and Madonna is finally off my screen, its was like ur nan giving ur tips on sex #cringe #superbowl

Congrats to Madonna, her #superbowl halftime show has made America 5 to 10% gayer. (and wasn't too bad)

Is Cee low supposed to be Count Dracula? Wait, I'm confused. Halftime show gone wrong. #superbowl

#Superbowl best halftime show ever. Usually cant stand the halftime show. This one was very entertaining.

#NowWatching: Madonna, Niki Minaj and Ceelo  #SuperBowl halftime Go #Giants

I never understood The Madonna phenomenon. Probably never will #SuperBowl #Madonnabowl #HalftimeShow

If Madonna vaporizes, we get World Peace? #Superbowl

Thank. God for twitter ,this Halftime show was the best #SuperBowl

I love #BettyWhite. She makes me smile. #SuperBowl #commercials

I love how Sue Sylvester is trending just bc of #vogue I thought Madonna did great! :) so proud of her. #superbowl

Unlike the people I'm watching the #superbowl with, I thought that halftime show was boss status. #Madonna

TBH, halftime show was better than I thought it would be. #SuperBowl #GIANTS

#SuperBowl - I thought it was a great touch having fall out of Madonna 's dried out twat! #Bravo

She could've had like a prayer as the entire show and I would've been happy. But thank god she blew up for world peace. #SuperBowl

First halftime show I've watched all the way through #superbowl #notbad

Ok, that was a good halftime show!  Go #MaDonna! #SuperBowl

Madonna killed the #Superbowl!! Janet Jackson's will always be the memorable to me

Did MIA just flip us the bird? Bravest play of the game so far. #superbowl

Anyone know which company did the graphics on the stage display? #production #superbowl #halftime

After watchin that abomination people must be wishing they had invited #TheWho back to do the #SuperBowl halftime

The Americans can sure do a HalfTime show! We need to get that in England! #SuperBowl

Well, seems #Madonna knows how to make an exit too. #SuperBowl

Probably more crotch thrusting in the dressing room though #superbowl

O' #Madonna, nothing looks like a #Misery when ur performing #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl #America

Voice commercial.. best one so far. Hands Down. #superbowl

Thank you #BettyWhite - finally a cute commercial during the #superbowl

Congrats Mr. Gale and Play360 for promoting healthy schools and living. #Play360 #Superbowl #SB46

I must meditate to cleanse my mind of that halftime experience, serious coding #superbowl

Not crazy about Madonna but the special effects were awesome #superbowl

I read the best #superbowl halftime tweets to my non-tweeting fam during halftime. #whirledpeas.

Madonna killed it.  Gaga take note. #superbowl

Being attracted to Betty white is border line necrophilia. #SUPERBOWL

My favorite part of the halftime show was the tribute to Ron Artest at the end #superbowl

Madonna left no detail untended at the #SuperBowl: her gilded panties matched her gold lame gladiator skirt #Stylin'

Was that it ! #Madonna expected a bit more than that.. Disappointing lets hope the Giants to better. Go G-men! #SuperBowl #Madonna

according to CNN, songs performed #superbowl see a 400% sales increase. Dough is flowin Madona's way big time.

Brilliant Madonna! You have shown these young upstarts how it's done. They just have been mega-schooled. #superbowl #madonna

Verbose contrarian opinion about Madonna's performance. #teameltonjohn #superbowl #imarevolutionary

I'm gonna have to disagree Bob. Prince 2007 was the best half time performance at a #Superbowl

I wonder if We will ever see McComb local rappers on Dha #SuperBowl one day . . ?? Y'all gone rock Dat bit ?? *shrugs*

The NFL 60 kid who brought game ball out is from Weddington NC  #clt #superbowl #randomfacts

How awesome would it be if a big giant Lady GaGa head just appeared and started singing Paparazzi #superbowl

Awesome Finale to half-time show #madonna #mdna #superbowl #worldpeace

way to many adverts. Not enough game play #superbowl

Damn it, I was hoping was going to elbow drop Madonna midway through! Now that would have been a spectacle! #Superbowl

Who was the 3rd lass on the half time show? #SuperBowl

Madonna, Nicki Minaj, and Cee-Lo strange mix but it worked #SuperBowl hafltime show

Even if she was lip singing Madonna's old ass can still move, best halftime show I've seen in a minute, at least it wasn't BEP #SuperBowl

i LOVE that #she-ra is trending right now #superbowl

Ok, thank goodness Madonna was able to perform without oxygen, or without breaking a bone, now let's get back to football please! #SuperBowl

I thought she looked a little drunk or confused #Superbowl #Madonna

That was the weakest halftime #Superbowl show ever, I thought nicki  minaj or ceelo green would have saved it but I was wrong!

I really liked vogue of Madonna and her performance!!!  #SuperBowl  #Madonnameacabasdecallarelhocico

Well after that Halftime Performance who cares if the Patriots or Giants wins! #MadonnaBowl #SuperBowl

I think I'm the only one in the world not watching #SuperBowl. I did watch #Madonna halftime show. It was weird to see her perform old songs

Go giants!!!!! Watching this alone by choice and loving it :) #superbowl

So Madonna showed her Depends on national tv & the Internet? That's HOT! #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow

it's the #Superbowl how can you not play celebrate?

#Cee-lo grabbing to hide #Maddonna warddrobe malfunction wouldn't have worked.   #SuperBowl

#Christian louboutin shoes all over #SuperBowl first cee lo green, now Christina aguliera.

Kristin: Is that Gene Simmons? NoRussell Simmons? Me: Neither. Are you thinking of Richard Simmons? #superbowl #thatdudeonthetightrope

#Madonna with the Metta World Peace Shoutout.  Things we didn't know were coming #SuperBowl Sunday

Can't stand anyone who lip syncs.  If you can't sing live (and Madonna can) just don't perform. #superbowl

Omg I am so happy this shit is over! Wtf was this for half time show O.O? #superbowl

One of the better halftime shows I've seen for the #SuperBowl ! #SB46

Young people all over the country must be wondering why Lady Gaga looked so old and unlike a man. #superbowl #Halftime

The Voice commercial with Betty White is officially my favorite.  #superbowl #commercials

Omg love spending time with my family and my adopted brothers jared and noland! #superbowl

Not a Madonna fan, but WOWZAS! That was good as hell! #superbowl

If the Packers aren't involved, then I'm not even vaguely interested. #SuperBowl #CommanderKeen  =P

1971: Southeast Missouri State Marching Band #SuperBowl

Madonna removes her flesh suit to reveal Tim Tebow who then teabags Janet Jackson and Steven Tyler, all while drinking a bud. #SuperBowl

Betty White we love you for your everything!!! #Epic #SuperBowl

Twitter is great because an entire nation can get together and make fun of a middle-aged lady all at the same time #SuperBowl #cyberbullying

When I'm 53 I hope I can still drop it and pop it like that. #SuperBowl #Madonna

I won't lieI loved that. But then she ended on my favourite, so I was happy. #madonna #superbowl

Later this afternoon after watching the #PuppyBowl in the living room, I felt sleepy. I turned on bedroom TV for #SuperBowl & fell asleep.

I can't wait for #Superbowl VXVIII when the halftime show features a popular musical act from this year

Bless her heart.  Those songs are are out of place as her lip-syncing at the #superbowl

Did anyone else see MIA flip off the camera? #SuperBowl

Truly spectacular halftime show at #SuperBowl . Yes, it was better than meatloaf at the #afl grand final

#TheAwkwardMoment when you enjoy the halftime show more than the game at the #superbowl #timetodosomethingmanly

Clint just saved half time #Superbowl

how do halftime shows seem to get worse every year? #superbowl

RT Oh my god, they smelted Madonna down into World Peace! We all win! #Superbowl

hahahaha Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake are trending lol #superbowl

Way to go Madge - but any in the closet superbowlers will now be too emotional to play #madonna #superbowl

Am I really watching #superbowl boys in leggins #notagoodlook

smashed it but unsure on the whole performance as #Madonna lip synced I think, fun though! #SuperBowl

Madonna was def lip syncing, but she put on a good show. World Peace at the end. LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, MIA, Cee-Lo Green all out. #SuperBowl

I just realized #halftime means this shit is only half over. #SuperBowl

Madonna did a great job!! Lip syncing that is :P #SUPERBOWL

Admit I was skeptical, but definitely liked Madonna's halftime show. was fab, and I need a pair of thigh-high boots. #SuperBowl

RT What's older Coke using the polar bear commercial for ANOTHER year or Madonna? #Superbowl

I totally agree with you. Its all about keeping your brand marketable and she is doing just that. #superbowl

I wonder if Lady Gaga will still be rockin' in her 50's. #madonna #superbowl

That was phenomenal! #Madonna is timeless! & were fantastic as well! #SuperBowl

Next year's halftime show: Betty White. #SuperBowl

worst MF halftime show ever #SuperBowl

Madonna was amazing! Really great halftime show. #superbowl

There was your 12 minute reason why should've played halftime.#superbowl

I must go to a #SuperBowl at some point in my life, looks incredible!

Some high quality miming going on there. #superbowl

Most memorable!! RT Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake Was The Best #SuperBowl Performance Cause I G

I don't care one way or another about Madonna, but those stage effects were pretty awesome. #SuperBowl

Alright #SuperBowl,Off to workeveryone come see me for some $2.25 long islands after the game!!

Well, Madonna just relaunched her US career #superbowl #halftime

#Superbowl halftime show was really great!  Do your thing, Madge!

Alright, lets get back to Football!!  #Patriots #Giants #SuperBowl #NFL Lets Bring Home the W #PatriotNation

MADONNA BECAME THE GAME!!! SHE TOOK IT BY STORM! INCREDIBLE! SHE LOOKS GREAT! HOW CAN THE GAME ITSELF TOP THAT PERFORMANCE? #Superbowl

Woah now, that was a damn good halftime in a long ass time! #nfl #superbowl

That was honestly the worst half-time show ever #SuperBowl

Just starting the DVR of #superbowl after the #puppybowl. I think Tebow could do it this year #dontwatchfootball

All right Madonna, that was cute. Brave tricks in the heels. Also, would love to see a Madonna/Nikki Minaj record #SuperBowl #halftime

Haha Netflix has probably been better than this #Superbowl

LOVE #Madonna!! Like a prayer!! One of my favs great performance! #SuperBowl

Halftime takeaway: Bob Ross' son is a fantastic tightrope artist. #Superbowl

Is this guy still alive? Clint Eastwood long time not see u! #Superbowl

What is this depressing commercial all about omg.#Superbowl.

So Wassup with this Dirty Harry commercial? #SuperBowl

SO annoying.  Now we have to hear how amazing madonna was and all I heard were prerecorded tracks #lipsyncing #superbowl #garbage

Tuned in #Superbowl just to see Madonna. Glad we did! Great halftime show. Back to 'Vicky Christina Barcelona.'

LMAO all the fags are loving Madonna's performance I'm correcting them by saying you mean her lip sync for her life?#SuperBowl

Clint Eastwood just told you! #SuperBowl

yes. Yes they did. And there are no great #SuperBowl commercials on, just CTV show ads. It's terrible.

okay no longer care for the #superbowl. Now I wait for #DowntownAbbey and live tweeting about it.

Still trying to decide if they were actually singing live or not..?. #SuperBowl

Oh, #BettyWhite, I'll always love you for your body. #SuperBowl

#madonna was amazing during halftime show of #Superbowl she brought it.Nice direction, choreography, lightning.

At the official superbowl party at the sound academy #superbowl

Madonna's performance gave me embarrassment shivers. Something was a bit off. I was mostly a fan of Cee Lo's sequin choir robe. #SuperBowl

So at the half the score is NY Giants 9-10 New England Patriots. Still a wide open game #superbowl

That was definitely the best #SuperBowl half-time I've seen since MJ did it They went in on Vogue!!  and dancers killed it!

How did Ron Artest get his name on the field? #SuperbOwl

Clint Eastwood is OLD, but by god he can hold an audience #superbowl

The Game, The Music, The Fashion - Share your thoughts about the #SuperBowl performances with us !

Manning and Cruz need to link up again here, Tom Brady's to fucking much though! Come on the Giants #superbowl

The #GOP needs to hire Clint Eastwood and the director of the Chrysler commercial to help with messaging. #superbowl

Madonna is too old! She looked so awkward doing that!! She wasn't even singing!! #SuperBowl #MadonnaSuperbowl

Best part of Super Bowl so far was Richard Simmons on a tightrope #superbowl

Best halftime I've seen in a long time! #SuperBowl

LOL! That disappearing trap door thing. That's how I'm going to leave business meetings from now on #SuperBowl #RT via

Ok that halftime show was better than I expected! #Madonna #SuperBowl

Madonna got this thang bumpin wow  #superbowl #sb46

What's up with all these depressing #Superbowl commercials?

Kudos #CTV for not pirating the #superbowl signal from NBC. Makes me even more loyal to #CTV  Hate it when #global does it.

OMG Detroit has Clint Eastwood on its side WOW. #Superbowl

Clint Eastwood, you scare me a lil bit. & also make me feel the need to go buy a dodge. #halftime #Superbowl

#superbowl ok enough with the Detroit inspiration. #urgh! If we have to be inspired by the city of #Detroit, we're in big trouble.

#SuperBowl half time. Hat off to the old goat. #tightropeblokeisoffhisnut

Ready to storm the streets. Giants better come back. #SuperBowl

Every single person mimed on that stage #superbowl #shithouses

Then they play edge of glory. Go Gaga! Lmao #superbowl

Batman supports Detroit, and so should you. #superbowl #eastwoodforbatmanbeyondmovie

Nice of Madonna to give former   Indiana #Pacer  Ron Artest errr World Peace a shout out at half time.  #superbowl

Next year there'll be an Imported from Detroit commercial on when the Lions are in the #superbowl! maybe!

How u come back playing Gaga?? NFL got jokes #Superbowl

We saw 1st hand that it didnt take much to impress you on the #xfactor. #superbowl

Love Chrysler's new #SuperBowl traditions of truly inspirations 60 sec spots. From Eminem to Eastwood. #ImportedfromDetriot

Madonna just gave a shoutout to a.k.a. Ron Artest! #worldpeace  Fun #SuperBowl fact: Madonna is eighty-three years old.

Bitch slap in the face to #Madonna with the Gaga song intro to the second half. #superbowl

Star Wars 3-D cross promotion as Madonna is lowered into carbonite. #SuperBowl

maybe Clint should have mentioned who bailed out those auto companies so they COULD come back #superbowl #yourewelcomesignedtaxpayers

My first #superbowl without and Thankfully and are deputising.

LOL.  Are the gays even watching anymore?!  LOL! #superbowl #gays #fb

So is Clint Eastwood running for President?? ;) #superbowl

Those Chrysler copywriters nailed it two years in a row. #superbowl

Great I'm never gunna get this project done..now that I turned my damn tv on #Superbowl

Let's back  to the action! Tanx Madonna! Original show, old school songs! #superbowl

Umm  No, Detroit, you came back because the taxpayers were forced to bail all the car companies out. #Superbowl #ads

Gaga should have done the half time show #superbowl

Good But really thinking should have had a bigger part 3 !! #SuperBowl

Currently, 40% of NFL fans are women  the last 30 mins of the #superbowl were for them, including the most recent Gaga spot

Nacho bar at my house for #Superbowl! Let's do this Giants!  #Nachos

The other product that Clint Eastwood endorses is the new Listerine, now with razor blades and shards of glass. #SuperBowl

Clint Eastwood just had the best #superbowl ad. Hands down. Done. #Detroit # jobs #inspiration #jeep

Brady has completed 11 straight passes and Joe Montana, of course, has the record at 13 #SuperBowl #nyg #patriots

Don't hate.  Madonna killed it. Even in her 50s #SuperBowl

A commercial more inspirational than a half-time show! #Dodge #superbowl

LOVED that Clint Eastwood/Chrysler/Detroit commercial. Anyone have a link?? #SuperBowl #BrandBowl

What a tribute to #Detroit!  #superbowl Amen for a second half, second chances, and reinvention!

I guess they had a #Halftime show like that so that the females can have an input on the #SuperBowl lol

What's with all the dudes hating on Madonna? Get over it lads. Name a better Super Bowl half time. #superbowl

Of course, most of my anger about the halftime show is not so much directed towards Madonna as it is towards Billy Cundiff. #SuperBowl

I'm gonna say it. That was a great halftime show. #superbowl

Gotta love complementary drinks at Riley's #captinmorgansmodels #superbowl

Not a Chrysler fan, but the Clint Eastwood commercial was really, really good. #superbowl

1977: Los Angeles Unified All-City Band & Audience card stunt #SuperBowl

Now gaga is playing, this is definitely the #gaybowl for sure #superbowl #mdna was good, great costumes and choreo!

I soooo wanted #Madonna to kiss black Jesus #cee lo that would have made my weekend #SuperBowl

That's enough dramatic montages get in with it #superbowl #gopatriots

what deep fried foods am I eating for #superbowl ? Deep fried duck giblets. Yeah, 1%-in that shit.

#superbowl wow, the Detroit ad just sent chills down my spine

Damn, what a great #Chrysler commercial! Clint's got my vote, er I mean I'll buy! #sbads #superbowl

Your vocals slayed Madonna, but don't ever put on a black sequened robe again in your life #SuperBowl

Clint Eastwood - the coolest cat in creation. Dodge is my favorite commercial so far. #SuperBowl

#superbowl #superbowlcommercial #superbowlhalftime Clint you rocked that car ad!

The halftime show was ok!! Maddona lip sync the whole thing though.  Nikki sucked! Ceelo is my boy! #superbowl

Vamo al juegowe have pampers for giants #GoPatriots #Superbowl !!!

Was that a PSA?  Bailout $$ sprung for the 60sec spot.  #superbowl

have to say, that was the best #nfl #superbowl  half time show I have seen in years, great job

Best ad of the night #Chrysler. I believe in Detroit! Is Eastwood really republican? #SuperBowl

Ahora en #Venezuela ven el #SuperBowl I think its all about the party lol

Love, love, love #Madonna that was the best #SuperBowl halftime show ever. #loveher #queenofpop

TiVo'd half. Ate green chili. Returned to Madonna. Note to self: Wait an hour after eating next time. #superbowl.

Who would have thought that is watching #SuperBowl ?!

LMFAO, Nicki Minaj and Cee Lo Green had a great halftime performance! #superbowl #lol

Is it wrong to be wearing a Brady jersey while rooting for the Giants? #SuperBowl

Go Clint! Halftime in America. Sounds like an commercial. #SuperBowl

Halftime show is a ploy to lure gays and teenage girls to watch #Superbowl

Upset LMFAO only showed their faces for a minute and Madonna sang most of their songs & Cee Lo didn't even sing any of his songs!#SuperBowl

I don't know how so many people could be cheering after that. #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow

Really? Player credits are needed at the end of halftime?  Pretty sure we anyone who cares knows the player's names. #superbowl

#SuperBowl That halftime show was not as trash as the Black Eyed Peas last year

So if #Madonna is 53, I guess we won't get Beyonce at halftime until like #Superbowl 60!

Well The #SuperBowl halftime show wasn't horrible. At least it was a step up from the garbage Black Eyed Peas one last year. :)

Halftime was too short. Maybe I'll watch Dick Tracy now #Superbowl

Don't understand a 30 half time, may as well start a new game, sorry #superbowl give me the premier league any dayoff to bed!

We haven't rewound any of the game but we watched the Fiat twice. #Superbowl

Bob Costas is a machine. Is he ever NOT at a sports event? #superbowl

Finally we can watch football and not old woman wishing she was still a virgin #superbowl

Surprised at the strength of the Loved It vs Hated It halftime debate. #Superbowl  #brandbowl

America loves and accept you if your a performer at the #SuperBowl

Hopefully this game opens up and we have an old fashion Brady/Manning shoot out. #SuperBowl #Giants #Patriots

can't believe I'm missing you on #superbowl :'( omg love you so so so much! I'll have to watch it tomorrow #mybad xxxxx

Watching the #SuperBowl in 3D on my LED TV is amazing!

Time for this game to start getting good. #SuperBowl

This is shaping up to be a great rest of the game! #SuperBowl

I wish I could be watching the #SuperBowl. I feel liike im missing out on a really important national holiday

If Clint Eastwood is right & U.S. 2nd half based on Detroit car industry, well then buckle up, it'll be a bumpy ride #Superbowl

Seriously though, World Peace? What is this, the Miss America Pageant? #SuperBowl

Whoa, what a stage! As versatile as the artists/music! Next time more live please. Hope the end wasn't meant as career funeral. #Superbowl

Better football to watch, #superbowl or #LittleGiants? I'm goin with little giants.

Loved Clint Eastwood #SuperBowl add.. It's a subliminal pro message.. Yes America, 2012 is halftime, get ready! #CaDem

so why tf #rhoa not cominq on fuck the #superbowl im tryna watch marlo and them fiqht ! ctfu

Inspired by Madonna- VOGUE!!! As you can tell, I had a different idea for the Super Bowl. #DragRace #SuperBowl

I still think U2 in 2002 was the best halftime. The 3-d Elvis impersonating magician in 1990 is still the worst. #superbowl

Clint Eastwood makes me want to laminate my social security card with American Flags. #America! #superbowl #commercial

The #SuperBowl of 100% commissions! These two together would make a champion team   and

#superbowl It's half-time America - the voice of Clint- powerful huh

So, I thought Madonna's wire jumper was Richard Simmons for a sec. #confused #SuperBowl

Still rooting for the commercials I think they're gonna go all the way this game. #Superbowl

The #SuperBowl needs to end already so i can watch #TheVoice

#Superbowl XLVI w/the family! Pizza, wings & beer!

Madonna. You are NOT cute. Nicki Minaj should've been THE WHOLE half-time show. #superbowl

I'm going to stop watching this now. I've come to terms with the fact I don't get it. Whatevs. Madge was #amazeballs #superbowl

Did I miss the Christians to Lions bit? Maybe they bring Tebow as surprised guest star!! #superbowl

We're watching the #SuperBowl & the ladies are at the table doing other stuff.

Time for the second half still thinking the Giants will win :) #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl

That was a ridiculous halftime show! Thanks Madonna! #SuperBowl

Steers and queers liked that weird ass halftime show#superbowl

and Madonna came back with shuffling moves. #putitdowngurl #superbowl

Have you come down from the nerd-high yet?  Because I haven't. #superbowl #avengers

and lets end this shitty half-time show with an awesome message. world peace guys. #goodtryguys #superbowl

Especially after that shoutout to you to end her #SuperBowl Halftime Show!!

Hey, good to see Ochocinco be relevant this season. #Superbowl

JDay on the SB: Pretty clean game in first half. 0 turnovers. Just 37 yards in penalties Gs (2-5) Pats (3-5) combined 5-10 on 3rd #superbowl

Those field projections were legit! #SuperBowl

I found ocho cinco #ocho cinco #superbowl

Love Despise his team though. #superbowl

any one else watching #superbowl ?wallpaper at my site:

If only they had championship ball in a cup. #superbowl

Did yall see Kalenna's / #ChamberOfDiaries Album cover yet? can't wait til shes rockin the #SuperBowl -

Still thinking they should have gone with Betty White for the half time show. Or Jaleel White. I'm not picky. #superbowl

Best of the game so far? Watch #SuperBowl commercial

And finally: you're old. Not even #NickiMinaj can save you now. #Madonna #SuperBowl

I hope I look as good as Madonna when I'm 80.#SuperBowl

Best part of the #superbowl #halftime show was in a shiny garbage bag, very appropriate.

If #Chrysler had put that #Superbowl Ad cash to hiring some workers or repaying the bailout instead, then I'd take the

LMFAO! Madonna's halftime show was presented by a bag of psychedelic mushrooms. #superbowl #worldpeace

If The Giants win this game Manning will be more than the Self-Proclaimed top 5 best QB in NFL history. #SuperBowl

What's all this about Toga people and Clint Eastwood? #wut #notwatchingsuperbowl #SuperBowl

Tab count at half time: $580 out of $1000. #letsdothis #SuperBowl

#superbowl is supposed to be live here in OZ! Half time show just starting! WT!

Impressive how Madonna manages to not break her hip. is the show stopper, of course. #SuperBowl

Ochocinco kno wat he doin..he gave up bein a headline player 4 a ring #NFL #SuperBowl

Madonna. just let Nicki take over. #HalfTime #SuperBowl

Why isn't Clint Eastwood mayor of Detroit? #superbowl

Todd w/ delicious pulled pork sandwiches #ftw #fb #yum #superbowl highlight this far

What the F is happening?? Why is Madonna SOOO awkward??? #SuperBowl

Loving Madonna's halftime show. You ladies watching this? #SuperBowl #OMG

Have to head home soon to transition my Sunday night from #superbowl to #downtonabbey.

I can't believe you people are wasting your time with anything as neaderthal as the #superbowl. But love that fav restaurant had no line.

Halftime show was good based on the fact that Madonna wore sleeves. Don't scare the kids #SuperBowl

Illuminati in ya face. That's basically wat the #SuperBowl half time show was about huh lol

bro u just made a catch in the #superbowl congrats!!

laptop is all the way over the other side of the room who's winning? #DontGiveAshit #Superbowl

#MM #SuperBowl Madonna and Co. will be the talk of water coolers nationwide in the morning, as well as whoever wins the big game of course.

#superbowl has Madonna.. And here, our #afl grand final has Meatloaf. More like a shit sandwich if you ask me!

RT if you'd love to see sing at the #superbowl.

That easily could have been a shit show.  Madonna's still got it. #superbowl

Madonna has learned that there's no need to make fun of religion or disrespect ppl to make a great show!!! Go #Madge! #superbowl #worldpeace

right that's it, i'm throwing in the towel, i'm off to bed and expect to wake up in the morning to hear the giants won #superbowl

I wanted to hate it, but I didn't. It was just sort of there tho. #blah #SuperBowl

Pats up 10-9 at halftime, but making moves early in the second. Check out the first-half breakdown:  #superbowl

Madonna had an HBCU band, Black cheerleaders, Mississippi Mass Choir, Cee-Lo, LMFAO & Nicki Minaj! #SuperBowl aint NEVER been this BLACK!

Eli manning must be goin thru sum issues kuz today he aint playin like he want it I guess he aint get no pussy be4 da game lmfao #SuperBowl

i couldn't wait for you to in her big XFactor #SuperBowl commercial! i know you all were watchin

Let's go Pats. Time to start tweeting the #superbowl. #swag

The #SuperBowl half time was Epic half by Madonna.. Great little cameo from LMFAO

Some of these dudes have more junk in the trunk than me :ocheese and rice #superbowl

Viendo el #superbowl the all american way, con 3

Madonna is morphing into Sarah Jessica Parker. #superbowl

Let's get this second half underway like you finished the 1st patriots! #SUPERBOWL

#MADONNA #SuperBowl #amazeballs nothing else to say, she still has it!

Oh shit, that's right, there is a football game after all that. #superbowl ^MR

That #Chrysler 'We Are All Detroit' theme is way better than Chevy's 'anti-Ford' spot. #SB46 #Superbowl

I know! Let's send Rebecca Black! #SuperBowl

Tom Brady Ftw! Go Patriots Go! #superbowl

Rumbling. Bumbling. S/O Chris Berman #Superbowl

Uh oh.time for the #Patriots to take it.they were my pick for the #Superbowl to go head up wit the #Saints.

I'm watching #superbowl and really just don't have a clue whts going on confused.com

I think it's time to lose the pop shit and get a country or rock half time show going in the #Superbowl

Is Cee Lo in Balenciaga? How many extras are needed for a #Madonna #Superbowl half time show? Hundreds and one pair o

Dude Clint Eastwood commercial hands down most badasss commercial #superbowl

Only in America is the halftime interval at the sporting event actually longer than the actual sport action  #Superbowl

Two words: lip. sync. #nbc #nfl #superbowl #madonna  I thought she was one of those people that criticized other artists who did?

#superbowl half time wasn't as great.. shoulda been the main singer and not a cheerleader in back..

You know who won the first half of the #superbowl? Doritos! #BrandBowl

Reading our favorite #brandbowl tweets out loud. This #SuperBowl thing is fun!

Really need 2 c dis halftime #Superbowl performance frm #madonna EVERY1 seems 2 b talking about it! Gonna have 2 get dat up on internet 2mrw

Best #1 #SuperBowl Halftime Show I've seen #Madonna #TheMaterialGirl came to P=L=A=Y!!!

Madonna apparently just answered a question incorrectly on Who's Still Standing. #SuperBowl

The total amount of play in an NFL game is usually approx 11 mins altogether #fact #SuperBowl

After that #halftime show, I have a craving for Activia and Bingo. #superbowl

#SuperBowl #Madge you still got it! However, miss the provocative ways! I think you should gave performed#girlsgonewild f*em'

Pierre-Paul you scare the heck out of me!! #superbowl

Oh I loved the halftime show!!! Crazy shit!!! Madonna, the queen of POP is INSANE #superbowl #worldpeace

People are LOVING the Beckham H&M #Superbowl advert. It's up to 5th place in our dataviz #brandbowl -

Another halftime show and no tittiesI feel cheated.#SuperBowl

We watched for the #Superbowl Halftime!  No Madonna for Men!! Thank God! #fb

Good game then good half time show followed by Clint Eastwood in a commercial oh hell yeah! Yay! #SuperBowl

Where can I buy the next hot fashion item that will fly off store shelves? Cee Lo Green & Madonna sponsored Sequin Snuggies #Superbowl #SB46

pats starting to go up through the gears after starting in reverse!! #Superbowl

The #Chrysler Eastwood #superbowl commericial should be an Obama 2012 Commericial. It is #halftimeinAmerica!

Yes, Madonna's vocals were pre-recorded. Of course. But so were Whitney's and y'all didn't say shit. #superbowl

Don't know how to classify Madonna's half-time show. Totally innovative or absolutely crazy? #superbowl

I dont really like the #superbowl but being with my friends makes it so much fun. =D

Juiced watching #superbowl and look like #JPP will win the game.

Totally thought Clint Eastwood was running for president #SuperBowl #commercial

Smartest marketing of the day. #brandbowl  RT if you think #Madonna is rockin' it! #SuperBowl

The absolute key to this second half is methamphetamines.  #superbowl

Yes Madonna. World Peace as a final statement. Love it! #SuperBowl

DamnBrady just broke a Joe Montana #superbowl record most consecutive completionsDamn

My one (and probably only) #Superbowl tweet - Go #Patriots!

The reason Madonna miming doesn't bother me is because she's more than proved over the years that she can sing. She rocked the #SuperBowl :)

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. first tweet that's not about the #SuperBowl

I hope they add plenty of stoppage time at the end of this! The time wasting is worse than Stoke City. I recon an hour #superbowl

Dear Tom Brady, I love you and respect you, but what was with those cheesy-ass pictures just now? #Superbowl

#Youknowyoudontwatchsportswhen you leave the room while everyone is watching the #SuperBowl

Life is a mystery Tightrope guy, real entertaining Madonna's Madonna :) #halftime #superbowl

All the americans get cool #superbowl commercials and us brits get madonna being old and wrinkly

I'd like to see #TomBrady in the same kind of commercial as David Beckham. #superbowl

Sorry not a Nicki Minaj fan . #superbowl #cosign lol

Stop it with the Madonna insults. Her fans are not amused.  #Superbowl

Justin Tuck totally looks like Optimus Prime with that helmet grill. #SuperBowl

Madonna's performance was alot better than I thought it would be - half time is the only part of #superbowl that I watch

I just wanna say that I appreciate seeing someone salsa dance in the end zone #Cruz #boricua #superbowl

I think an AARP card is the pre-requisite for doing the #SuperBowl halftime show.

When does Eli get to play with the ball? #SuperBowl

Madonna's still got it. Best halftime show in a looooooong time. #SuperBowl

were those #Superbowl rings turned into cufflinks that kraft is wearing?

another boring half time show. #superbowl

For those of you keeping track, there have been ZERO shots of Peyton Manning tonight #SuperBowl

Shouts to Cee-lo Green your my new funny man!! Can I meet you already  #SuperBowl

I thought it was going 2 B a train wreck, I have to admit it's best half-time show I've seen in a few years. Thanks #Madonna! #SuperBowl

Now would be good or an interception, Giants. #SuperBowl

the tackles in that video were crazy, some one got completely crushed #SuperBowl

how much did Ron Artest pay to have his name put on the field at the end of the halftime show? #superbowl #lakers

Clint Eastwood makes me want to wrestle a bear! #SuperBowl

Ed Hocculi is hotter than Madonna. #SuperBowl

Shout out to for hosting our #SuperBowl party!

Do I stay up and watch the rest or do I go to sleep :/.. Decisions?!? #Superbowl

Co-ops are not known for cleanliness, it's like a frat house filled with hippies instead of douches. #Superbowl #Berkeley

Madonna has still got it. That's all #justsayin #SuperBowl

Best ad ever America, fuck yeah. #SuperBowl

Brady is performing SURGERY right here #Pats #SuperBowl

The word #SuperBowl still actually sounds kinda funny #LMFAO

Did anyone else ask how 6 chevy-owning MEN were going to repopulate the planet with nothing but a box of twinkies? #superbowl

I like that start much better! #patriots #SuperBowl

14 straight completions in #superbowl breaks the record that #JoeMontana set in Super Bowl XXIV

Exactly what you would expect to happen. Wake up Giants #Superbowl

Wow looks like the patriots are heating up after a very shitty start #SuperBowl

This must be the most mainstream use of projection mapping yet. #superbowl #halftime

#GMAYL & #SUPERBOWL are behind now we're waiting for the tour dates :D

he had a quiet first half but that quick touchdown shows how calm and collective he is #Brady #NFL #Patriots #Superbowl

I have never tweeted this much in my life. Damn #Superbowl.

That's ok. Eli gonna REALLY SHOW UP 4th quarter. #Giants #SuperBowl

Cameraperson please do not cut away from zany touchdown celebration dances. #superbowl

Anyone else notice how brady's new haircut makes him look kind of like chris jericho. #superbowl #y2j

Brady has just taken over this match #superbowl

Love Madonna! maybe next year Bieber? #SuperBowl

RT Yes, Madonna's vocals were pre-recorded Of course. But so were Whitney's and y'all didn't say shit. #superbowl

#SKEESPORTS final NFL pick of season: #superbowl (vs line not w/l)- New York (cont)

Well that's the game. Brady and the Pats are dialed in. Game over.  #Patriots  #SuperBowl  #Winning

Soooo did anyone else catch MIA flicking off the camera? caught it!! #SuperBowl #Madonna

Hernandez of the #Patriots plus extra points gives NE the 17-9 lead over #Giants #NYC #NFL #SuperBowl

Now the Pats D needs a big stop #superbowl

Well, she did almost fall twice, if that makes you feel any better. #superbowl

Touchdown..!!! Pats get a big lead..!!! #SUPERBOWL

Aaron Hernandez, the forgotten TE of the Patriots, with the TD reception. 17-9 #Patriots #SuperBowl

Tom Brady is your daddy! I dont even have to ask lololololol #PatriotNation #GoPats #SuperBowl

Open the vault! Hahaha. I like that TD celebration. #superbowl

The voice #SuperBowl commercial with Betty White was hilarious!

Was anyone else expecting a repeat of the Madonna, Xtina, Britney kiss between Madge, Nicki, & M.I.A? #SuperBowl

How come its 2012 and we're still picking people who were popular 25years ago for the #Superbowl halftime show lol

slow start pats but wow.. pushing hard now. #superbowl

I can't stop laughing with the TT's right now crazy people! #Superbowl

The super bowl is on one! Madonna performing and everything hahaha #SuperBowl

LACES OUT. DIE MARINO. ALRIGHTY THEN. #superbowl

last guy on the line should be shot, your in the #Superbowl end that man when he's coming for a TD

I am partial to penguins and am glad to see them with a role in the #SuperBowl  #ilovemadonnabut I love penguins more.

So far the most effective defensive player in the #Superbowl is a #ZOE #js

CLLLANG!!! That was the sound of the pin drop in here. We're not done, though. #Giants #BigBlue #SuperBowl

I think the giants only played for the first  quarter #SuperBowl

#JerseyNoise homework. How I'm spending my #SuperBowl evening. Greatness isn't waiting for sweaty men to beat the shit outa of each other.

Right!  Loved the Material Girl-meets-Ben Hur-meets-Fat Albert theme of the #Superbowl halftime show. Pur

Lady trying to get me play this game on her phone. Smh the darn #superbowl on

Let's Go Pats!!!! It's our turn this time #SuperBowl

The best part of the halftime show was the stage! Straight up #superbowl

It's getting less and less likely that Green Bay is going to take this thing #superbowl

#superbowl the internet xfinity ads was fun not clear though #sportment

I did, 117 of them!  :)   Anyone burn a few kcals dancing at halftime #SuperBowl

when Brady gets hot, nothing else really matters. He's 20/23 and his incompletions were a throw away & 2 batted down at the line #Superbowl

NBC, stop playing favorites. That was Boston you just played into commercial, you think I wouldn't notice? #superbowl

Can we have for the #superbowl halftime show next year? A ton of hits, relevant, good music & no lip syncing.

haha i have no idea, but ok :L im off to bed now i cant take this anymore im clueless, confused and tierd :L #SuperBowl

Since when does Will Farrell tightrope walk?  #Superbowl

what just happened? WHAT. JUST. HAPPENED. fuck off patriots. #superbowl

Thanks for the correction This is the 5th appearance at the #Superbowl 4 before tonight :)

Playing around with photo apps while I watch the #Superbowl.

Canadian #Superbowl commercials consist of Subway and about 12 different vehicle brands, celebrating lots of snow

World peacelaugh all you want but no wars have broken out since Madonna sang #superbowl

Nadal vs Djokvic at the Aussie was better than this Superbowl. #SB46

Don't make the Giants fans cry too hard Brady! They are kind souls haha #superbowl #Mvp

I look for what is on sale! Or have a coupon for! #CapeCodChipsParty  #superbowl

Ha ha, wonderfully fit at 53!Best half time! Worldpeace bithches! #superbowl #MDNA #worldpeace #MIAuniverse #awesome

TOUCHDOWN Pats another great drive and extra point is good Giants 9-17 Patriots #SuperBowl

Gotta go to sleep now #cantstayupmuchlonger hopefully I wake up to see the Patriots win and Brady get MVP #Superbowl

I can't help but love MIA #swaggerlikeus Did M.I.A. flip off the world during #superbowl halftime? Video:

I hope Brad dies it the only way Brad can. #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl yey for the Pats!  I'm a Pat'a fan because my hubby is from New Eanglad but mostly because I am a BIG fan of

Aaron Hernandez take it to the safe house and make it rain td celebration. Sick!!! #superbowl

I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE IN BRADY! Believe with me. You too will succeed! #superbowl

TOOOOOOOOOUCHDOWN!!! NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, GO GO!!! TOM BRADY, THE BEEEEEEEEEEST! #superbowl

how could I be after expelling all of my alcohol. Lol. Don't be a hater. That was pretty good. #superbowl

Brady vs. Manning, an epic game! #SuperBowl

#CallSam still airin during da #SuperBowl yeahhhhh Sam got some money!!!

#Patriots baby, that's what we do #superbowl

My dad is laughing at all of these #superbowl commercials! (:

#SuperBowl in #NewOrleans next yearthey should let #gram and #su bands go at it at halftime!!!!!!!!!!!!

Surprised Usher didnt perform Omg. He used to twice  a wk. #superbowl  cc:

#Superbowl Halftime show was amazing, you go Madonna3

#SuperBowl Had A Lame Pointless Ass HalfTime Show! I Was Expecting To Here Stupid Hoe Performed -_-

Say what u want about Madonna.. But 30 years later and shes still big.. Living legend! #Madonna #Superbowl

I hate political ads as it is, but I REALLY hate them being on the Super Bowl! #superbowl

You go from Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen and The Who to the Black Eyes Peas and now Madonna? Wtf was that? #superbowl halftime #fail

Someone just got fired!! No sound! #superbowl

cant deal with all these breaks, just get on with it! #SuperBowl

the amount of breaks in an american football game is ridiculous #superbowl

Its Clint Eastwood when has he ever been funny? #SuperBowl

Everybody is hating on the half time show because it wasn't a tatted up black man with gold teef. Go Madonna!#SuperBowl

Problem for the #Giants -- they dominated first half, but score didn't show it. Pats are on the roll now. #SuperBowl #SB46

That was the best #SuperBowl #halftime performance I've seen. Great singing by Madonna.

Who knew throwing #Madonna into a pit of death at the #superbowl would bring about world peace.. figures.

Wow. Best best best halftime show ever. Period. #superbowl

Remember that time CeeLo's robe fell off and it turned out he was three clever bulldogs. #superbowl

Like most major US sports, it's as much business and entertainment as sport. #superbowl

And any1 in this country tweeting about it or watching it knows fuck all about this shitty sport so why is everyone watching it? #superbowl

Always thought the lead singer of Poison had a lower voice than that #SuperBowl #halftimeshow

Halftime showpretty good!! More of  would've been nice though! #superbowl

That's okay cuz NBC will cancel it 3 weeks in.  #SuperBowl SMASH.  A show I'll never watch one second of.

I was thinking the same thing about #Smash . Also, I'm enjoying your #superbowl tweets - even if you are rooting for the devil.

In-zone dance was crazy tho! (opened the vault on niggas) #SuperBowl

The booking for this game is shit. should be head of creative! #SuperBowl  #FootballIsFixed

Ok #SuperBowl I'll be back gotta get to the money

2nd half. And I don't even follow football! Haha #NFL #Superbowl

David Beckham fans check out the H&M commercial wowsers.. is all I can say #Superbowl

I'm just glad there was no wardrobe Malfunction! Woulda been awkward for the world to see Madonna's Penis! #superbowl

Hernandez's bank vault / make it rain touchdown dance was just the highlight of the game. #SuperBowl

Is there a person whose sole job is to hold the football steady for the kicker? #superbowl

Retweet I you saw Brady spit! #superbowl

Ok, next year, Rush at halftime! Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Closer To The Heart set list. #2112 #nfl #superbowl

Sigh, I may never understand why brands use old ads for the #SuperBowl.  If you're going to make the investment, maximize it! #SB46

Hernandez TD celebration also choreographed by Madonna. #superbowl

So Madonna spent millions of dollars for a super bowl half time show and have the audacity to end it with world peace? #superbowl

Wait is that Vernon Davis? Oh, it's one of The Giants. I miss Vernon:( #yardage #superbowl

I'd have a better chance of making it on TV if I was a zombie. #superbowl

i cant see the giants getting back into this now #superbowl

Oops! Got caught up in watching the #StellarAwards on UPN & missed the #SuperBowl halftime show. Did I miss anything good?

Another cruise commercial during the #superbowl makes me want to go on another cruise oh so bad. #wishful thinking!

Oh shit.  Big ERA ads of right-to-work during the #Superbowl

was Amazing!!! #likeaprayer  #vogue my favorites!! She is an absolute #LEGEND !! #Madonna #MADONNASuperBowl #SuperBowl

Time to petition the #NFL to bring back more titty for halftime. Maybe we can start a poll to see #SB46 #Superbowl #IvoteDanica #GoDaddy

The only people who don't like super bowl, are the ones who don't understand it! #SUPERBOWL

Madonna wore jewelry to rival those #superbowl rings. Bulgari statement earrings and a Loree Rodkin Bondage ring.

Looks like wilfork ate ceelo! #superbowl

#Madonna without her headress #Superbowl XLVI Halftime

Madonna was amazing, and team is #winning #superbowl looking good

I would like to point out that Myra Kraft is not the widow of Bob. Someone please shut these commentators up.  #SuperBowl

Now, why do you think they have the #SuperBowl on Sunday? Why can't we have elections on Sundays? #fuckingPolitics

Hugeee! Didn't know that Cee Lo Green played American Football #superbowl

+ Madonna + gold pom poms = #SuperBowl fabtime show

The Giants Got The Game Anyway They Just Putting On A Show For The #SuperBowl They Laughing On the Side

I seriously hate the Patriots more than any other team in the existence of sports. #Superbowl

A little Tout VID from Shaq at the Halftime show!  #superbowl #madonna #worldpeace

I feel so left out in Australia without the #SuperBowl

The Giants better get their shit together before people cause a riot. #SuperBowl

There hasn't been any turn overs this game #SuperBowl maybe it's time for one

I'm sixty and I know it #superbowl // haaaaaa!!! Muy bueno norrey!

I don't understand how people don't like Madonna. She's a music legend, AND she is in her 50's and can still kick ass on stage. #SuperBowl

Both Puerto Ricans have scored TD's in the #superbowl. Aaron Hernandez and Victor Cruz. -WEPA!!!

Now its time for a NY(actually NJ) score. I'm rooting for a good game, not just for a team! #superbowl

FIST DOWN GIANTS, LET'S GO! #GoGiants #SuperBowl

My family are all watching the #Superbowl in different rooms. # wtf

oh nooooooo!!! I was looking forward to the show! The #superbowl is whack!! I need my RHOA fix.

Tom Brady taking over a game once dominated by the Giants, time to step up Eli Manning #sb46 #superbowl #anyonebutthepatriots

Aight ready to get in front of this tv just scooped me from the airport #TeamPats #superbowl

i feel this game is no good, my numbers aint worth a piss on #dammit #superbowl

Now they just have to keep this lead!!! #ThePatriots #SuperBowl

I wonder if he has realized that San Fransisco isn't playing #SuperBowl

Send me a pair!! Did you catch Sky Blu rocking our $1MIL dollar headphones? #SuperBowl

This #superbowl was already going pretty gay, and then the Kraft-kissing began.

It's amazing to think that Darth Vader, a character that was in a movie in 1977, has been in a number of #SuperBowl 2012

Thanks Madonna. Now I know what it's like to see a geriatric stripper. I recognize that vag; I think the cryptkeeper lives in it #SuperBowl

They're trying to bang so much! #footballporn #SuperBowl

Holy balls is this game boring.  I'd be more witty but between the commercials, the game, my brain is slowly turning to mush. #SuperBowl

In real time it's been an hour since Manning held the ball  #Superbowl #patriots

That boy Hernandez opened the bank vault and made it rain hahahah #Superbowl

He's been watching the #SuperBowl commercials too much.

Watched Madonna's half time show , it was awesome :) #superbowl

'The way he explodes up the middle' #dodgy commentary #superbowl #plymouth2012

Only way I will accept the patriots winning is if Chad scores a touchdown!!! Lol let's go GIANTS! #superbowl

Wilfork on the Patriots looks like Cee Lo Green's big brother #Superbowl #TheVoice #BaldChocolateGummyBear

Me am little Joey match! Come on Giants!! #SuperBowl

Three words.  President. Clint. Eastwood. #SuperBowl

Number 75 on the Patriots looks like Shrek! #SuperBowl

yup I think my team will start to run away with this now #superbowl #StMirren

RT Pinning  Superbowl. I made it through a whole quarter this year though. #Pinterest #Superbowl

Robert Kraft's cufflinks make me want to break his hip. What a dickface. #superbowl #fuckTHATguy

chris brown or tony kiwan!!! Yellah habibiii!!! Hahaha love you! Next year #superbowl party at mi casa!!!

My twitter feed is snarking on Madonna & my FB feed thinks she was great  what does that mean? lol  #superbowl

Ford has sent GM and NBC asking to pull the Chevy apocalypse ad that slams Ford. BAAAHAHA! #superbowl

Hahahaha I knw someone was gonna rub my face in it. No worries! We're gonna come back! #Giants #SuperBowl

Those cap sleeved jerseys some of the players are wearing are kind of girly looking.  #SuperBowl

My favorite part was seeing #Madonna shufflin, tbh #SuperBowl And her actually singing #OpenYourHeart

Ok, the game Battleship, is now a movie. Guess they're waiting until next year to release Risk and Stratego. Monopoly got panned. #superbowl

Mad af! I missed all the #SuperBowl commercials

The Giants , need too PICK IT UP ! #SuperBowl

Fun stat: #SuperBowl Sunday is the biggest winter grilling day of the year. Were you grillin' it up today?

I like reading all the English people's tweets about the #superbowl.. Just face it, your like me.. Don't understand it or give a shit.

Someone needs to cut the #superbowl viewing stats to show the pre and post Madonna ratings.

Im listening to the 2nd Gnarls Barkley record alot right now.  Cee Lo is the jam! #goodiemob #superbowl

Of course God is helping you to win this game. He took a break from saving dying kids to watch the #Superbowl, just for you. #ThereIsNoGod

The #superbowl is going to have a great finish watch

Im Not Watching Da #SuperBowl No More..Yall Who Winnin??

Being able to cheer for the team you own in the #Superbowl looks like fun #HowRichPeopleLive

I'm having more fun reading the tweets about Madonna than watching the actual game #SuperBowl

Wat Wud Yal Say If I Told Yal I Beted On Both Teams? #SuperBowl

I agree.  She looked amazing, but I'm really not a fan of lip syncing.  I prefer live vocals.  #madonna #halftime #superbowl

Clint Eastwood  = #Superbowl #MVP what an absolute legend. once in a lifetime character. #respect

Look, Madonna - if you need to dance in Sketches shape-up's - then dance in shape-up's !! No shame #SuperBowl #Madonna

#superbowl is getting out of hand with bradys hot streak

So far it good im loving the #superbowl

Trying to watch the #Superbowl with a possitive attitute, but i gotta be honest #boring

Look closely. This is what goes for #Superbowl #controversy these days?

Really need to sleep but I'm too into the #SUPERBOWL

The city with first Public Library is disputed. Sidis claims the first public library was Boston's in 1636 #chevygametime #superbowl

No words can describe Cee Lo and his sequins gown #SuperBowl

C'mon, Giants, keep this game interesting at least. #superbowl

Hahahahaha.  Compared to Dad's funeral, this halftime show is overproduced. #SuperBowl

Toooootally skipping the #SuperBowl. It's a #MyFairWedding marathon for me. I don't know who I am anymore.

Dang thanks for the invite to the #SuperBowl party! Tell I appreciate that after our bonding time at Busch Gardens

Pues mi novio trato de explicarme esto and I still don't give a fuck about #SuperBowl

I liked Madonna. She rocked it! #superbowl

I have so much to do and i had no time to do it all day. #concert  #puppybowl #SuperBowl

My 4 yr old is making sighs of disgust at the tvnot at all sure of why he's doing it. #likefatherlikeson #Superbowl

All you Americans out there. Half time show done by from Montreal.  Many talents come from outside of the USA #Superbowl

#Madonna message of world peace symbolised through the ever so peaceful romans #superbowl

Just changed into my man's JPP jersey and my black-and-white Victoria's Secret referee-style g-string. Let's go, G-Men!!!!! #SuperBowl

OUCH! Nicks just got POPPED. #SuperBowl

The dark side: MT Super Bowl And The Sex Trade  via #superbowl

eff the #superbowl, rather be watching this football game.

Really confused by all the Canadians crying about not seeing American commercials. #SuperbOwl

Number 75 for Patriots is one big guy. #SuperBowl

Pizza, beer, nuggets, and commercials. That's what the #Superbowl is about.

Pretty sure Chris Collinsworth's job in life has been to be balls-deep in whatever team I DON'T want winning the #superbowl #SoOverBrady

Haha I bet clo's ex wife was jealous that he now is singin with Madonna at the #SUPERBOWL ain't that a bitch!

I just can't help but thinking that Madonas knees must've been killing her. #arthritis #superbowl

Long live the Queen of Pop Madge!!! Total middle finger to the haters!!! #SuperBowl

2008:  Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers /  2009: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band / 2010: The Who #SuperBowl

Madonna probably could have bought world peace with the amount of money that production cost. #superbowl #sportsmatch #wtf #perspective

I got to pee but don't want to miss a commercial. #SuperBowl

I almost started paying attention to the game, but then I remembered it's still the Giants playing the Patriots. That was close. #superbowl

Quite a following for #superbowl from the #twitterclarets Wonder if Eddie is watching?!

By the way big let down on commercials this year #brandbowl #superbowl

Is it wrong that I sometimes want to have sex with all of you? The feeling is fleeting & a bit private butreal none-the-less. #SuperBowl

The #Patriots defense is really bad but somehow finds a way to make big plays when it needs to. #SuperBowl

Can I just say again how impressed I was with the halftime show? For real - 5 big acts in my state capitol?! #Indianapride #SuperBowl

[Laughs at the commentary] Sorry young ones think the #superbowl is distracting everyone.

Who will win the #superbowl? My bet is done GO GIANTS! #NYGiants

That's how I like to roll, too. Enter a squares pool to force myself to care about the game. #superbowl #brandbowl

You could see so much of chung's attitude in that shot! #pats #superbowl

#SuperBowl - Insight & analytics brought to u by #SAP - #Giants vs. #Patriots: Does the Upset Shed Light on a Rematch?

He's going to have a hard time going to the bathroom tomorrow #superbowl

Lil B set his mark on the #SuperBowl with Hernandez' cooking dance S/O - a legend in the making.

Hey Canadians! See the ads you wanted to watch, but couldn't  #SuperBowl

Americans must be stupid & have short attention spans.thats why they have to stop and explain what jus happened every 5s #SuperBowl

RT All jokes aside, I'm glad Detroit is finally recovering from 9/11. #SuperBowl

#Superbowl Patriots are hitting like a ton of bricks

I wonder if #Syria's Assad knows today is the #SuperBowl? America is busy watching commercials tonight. #Homs #BabaAmr

Pats should win already so I can watch and Cee Lo Green's stubby little arms. #SuperBowl

The #SuperBowl just isn't the same without all the commercials. Here's what the Twitterverse had to say. STORIFY:  #SB46

All ONE BIG SATANIC RITUAL REVIVAL OF ROME/TYRANNY ALL OF SATANS PUPPETS ON STAGE COMMERCIAL OF THE END THINK! #Halftime #SuperBowl #Madonna

Tynes' 38 yard FG is good. Patriots 17-12. 6:43 3rd.#SuperBowl

1 Super Bowl ring could feed 50 poor families for 2 years. #SuperBowl

I LOVE this Fiat commercial. So Euro! # AdWIN #SuperBowl

That dude likes Fiats a little too much.  #SuperBowl

Need more than field goal,  #gmen  #superbowl

On a side note, I'm happy Madonna conquered World Peace tonight. She must have been busy in Afghan, Syria, Israel and Palestine? #SuperBowl

I'm watching not watch the #superbowl while I'm watching the #superbowl. #strategicallypositionedintheroom

A Fiat has never given anyone an erection. #superbowl

Which is why I'm off to bed. Go #Patriots Nite. #Superbowl

Something makes me think you liked the Fiat commercial  #Superbowl

I already forgot the first time I saw you Fiat. I already forgot. Don't remind me of J-Lo. #Superbowl #BrandBowl

tmo is gonna be werid since i didnt watch the #SuperBowl

who was that woman? #superbowl #fiat I don't get it.

I've seen little league games more exciting than the #Superbowl

Lipsynched? Of course, even that harp was a Lyre. #Madonna #Superbowl

And that Fiat commercial takes the crown from BMW. #SuperBowl

Smart to hide Madonna's sinewy musculature. Actually a decent cameo-filled greatest hits show. #SuperBowl

Some serious pad popping going on at  #Superbowl Regis!?

All I know is that I love her shoes. Forget the car.  #adbowl #superbowl

madonna lip synced so bad they dropped her into hell. the end. #superbowl #halftime

There's too much football getting in the way of all these ads #brandbowl #sbads #superbowl

And he leveled him!  I love all the big hits. #SuperBowl

Janet's performance was HOT!! but Prince in 2007 was my fav by far!! #Superbowl

Ochocinco = WIN. Anyone who bargain-shops for jeans in their underwear is a bold genius. #Superbowl

I loved the #Fiat commercial!!! Haha ohh these Italians! #Superbowl

I don't think I can stay awake much longergunna havta give the rest of it a miss #superbowl

WTF refs! I see pats arrived into Indy early to buy the refs. Always cheating. That was a CLEAR helmet to helmet! Lead with it! #SuperBowl

I don't care what anyone says, the halftime show was great. #superbowl

Fiat commercial was great! Regis Go back to Kelly. #SuperBowl

#Superbowl Pats more physical now, giants lost momentum

Loving the #Fiat commercial with the Italian speaking woman! #SuperBowl

All this football makes me want to go out buy a car and some pepsi maxx #Superbowl

Fiat 500 #SuperBowl ad just cracked me up! It's the big game, laughing welcomed. #advertising

I just ordered the Italian version of Rosetta Stone! #SuperBowl

Fiat commercials? During the Super Bowl? What happened to this country? #nfl #superbowl

#FAIT #Superbowl 'bout fell off my chair watching that FIAT comm.

In the Adriana Lima #Superbowl #SBads contest, it's Fiat 1, Teleflora 0

I think that Fiat commercial did  things to me. #SuperBowl

U are disturbing me from the #SUPERbowl! *Katt Williams voice* I am tired of your tweets! #DISMISSED !!

Regis, I love you lmfaoo #superbowl

Beer and Pizza That's the way to do it! #SuperBowl

Am I the only one who wants to see the Clint Eastwood/Rebel Romney debate? #Superbowl #EastwoodForPresident

I wonder what and Thinking about right now #superbowl #TheJeffOwensRadioShow

JDay on the SB: Patriots 17 Giants 12, 6:43 left 3rd; Moore hit on 3rd down forces FG by Tynes. Brady, Manning combined 38 for 47 #superbowl

No, I didn't mean at the #SuperBowl I meant to talk. Thoughts On #SB46?

Okayish car commercials. patriotic beverages and sexist crap. #superbowl #ads

Appears Pats defense took out old-style hit 'em high, hit 'em low, just hit 'em play book #SuperBowl 1/2 time no #Madonna for them

#superbowl Madonna looked Super hot, Cee Lo added nothing as did Niki Minaj.. LMFAO was lame-o. The talent diminishes.with youth!

raise your guys' standards for a Halftime show. This is the #SuperBowl not the #GreyCup

And pepsi max burns Coke Zero.  Good one #superbowl

Car commercial sucked that time and the #Pepsi max one was pretty funny #SuperBowl

#SheProbablyAHoodrat if she's never watched football in her life and acts like she's a die hard fan the day of the #superbowl

Whoa, they played Smashing Pumpkins Gish era going to commercial :o  #superbowl

Not will Eli lose this #SuperBowl but he also loses the hot wife contest.

#superbowl ? Man I aint even watch that shit

Aerial coverage at a game being played indoors? #superbowl

Madonna still on fire, what a show! Yeah yeah Super bowl.. #superbowl #easy

#Madonna #Superbowl performance was tha best 1 Ive seen SINCE #JanetJackson lol

Urgh! We are missing the #superbowl Definitely need access to the outside world of entertainment soon.

Apparently #Fiats are for men who suffer adequacy issues. #superbowl ads

Ummm, I think I'll eat some cereal while watching the #SuperBowl

Alright that's enough #SuperBowl for meoff to catch some sleep

Eli's wife looks more deezed than he does #superbowl

I want the reinvented baby that doesn't poop! #toyota #superbowl #commercial #reinvented

Follow me if u think the giants r gonna win #Giants #SuperBowl

This game is picking up, some good drives and solid hits. Boom. #bbcsuperbowl #SuperBowl

Hey can I have that baby that doesn't poop? #superbowl

I'm sure plenty of people would love these 'reinvented' products from Toyota haha especially the non pooping baby and the couch #SuperBowl

Why is there aerial coverage at the #SuperBowl? It's an indoor stadium!

My uncle, on #SuperBowl bling: Only a gay man would wear a ring like that.

For introducing a baby that doesn't poop, Toyota wins this round. #SuperBowl

Whoever writes these commercials couldn't even teach a Level 1 class #superbowl

You're just jealous! She looks awesome. #superbowl

There's no use in using #Superbowl cause u can't read anything it

Makes me want to learn Italian. Nice foam, Fiat. #Superbowl

My art work during half time #footballcakepops #superbowl

dear toyota, that commercial confused me but i do like the non-pooping time machine baby. #superbowl

Really don't know American Football rules #superbowl

No football fan really wants to watch Madonna#SuperBowl

I just want the reinvented rain. #superbowl

Imagine if they had these timeouts in 'soccer' they'd kick off and then go in for a break a min later. #boring #toomanybreaks #superbowl

Some of yall need some reinvented rain!! lmfaoo #Superbowl

C'mon defense! Stop the #patriots momentum now. Go #Giants #Superbowl

Let there be love in the world of soft drinks guys, especially if the world's going to come to an end soon! #SuperBowl

Love watching the #superbowl so I can find out about ALL the new movies coming out.

This Coca Cola bear is me right now. #Superbowl

Please no more scores this quarter. I've got 2-7. #SuperBowl #neversawitcoming

why do you play the exact same ads during every break?!? #SuperBowl

OMG Can we please reinvent rain?!?! #superbowl #commercial

Toyota ad. Clever, but saw it online first. At least they made the couch in female and male versions. #SuperBowl

Toyota reinvent rain to make people skinny. Yeah, I wish. #SuperBowl

I'm a Giants guy, but I'm also a realist.NEVER EVER bet against Vegas.#Superbowl

Somebody said the Giants were playing in the #SuperBowl. Too bad it's the new York ones. I'd much rather see

Was going to go out to watch the #SuperBowl but somehow ended up in my bed! :-)

these coca-cola polar bear #commercials after Xmas don't feel right #superbowl

So ummdo you think I'm burning off calories from 4 hot wings by being upset over #superbowl score?

I think archie Manning has something on these announcers 30 yrs ago in New Orleans.They have man crush on whole family. #superbowl #football

Sex, sex, sex. Oh wait, its a Fiat ad? #SuperBowl

Nothing against Madonna, but the best parts of that halftime show were when the other guys were singing.  #honestly #superbowl #halftime

I'm waiting for one of these Coca-Cola polar bears to fall through the ice for a Global Warming ad. #SuperBowl #Commercials

The irony, lol! RT RT if you think #Madonna is rockin' it! #SuperBowl

Uncle Jesse from full house lol wow everyone making a comeback during these #SuperBowl commercials

The Fiat commercial make me feel dirty #superbowl

Which kid commercial in the #SuperBowl do you like best? I liked the Chase smart phone sending money ad but still

Great branding using John Stamos for Oikos Greek Yogurt! He definitely helps sell the product. #SuperBowl

#ItsFunnyHow the coca cola polar bears lasted longer than the Budweiser frogs #SuperBowl

Damnknow I can't get no #greenery cuz all these niggas watching the #superbowl. Not even bout to upset myself like that. Lol smdh

what are these polar bears watching?!  is it Big Miracle #SuperBowl

Asking where is the mom of a kid with two dads is, insulting Cee-Lo Green to the chagrin of on-lookers I ruined #Superbowl this year.

Greek Yogurt ad with John Stamos: very good! #SuperBowl

Never mess with a woman and her greek yogurt!!!! #superbowl

I know that beezy didn't just headbutt Uncle Jesse for some Greek yogurt. #Superbowl

ima need the giants to tightn up that defense tho #superbowl

Hey, John Stamos is still alive! #SuperBowl

Bill Satan is giving the business to the Giants, coaching one Hell of a game #superbowl

Coke/Polar Bear Commercials are so cool! #SuperBowl

#Fiat got the best car ad yet! #brandbowl #Superbowl - I think I found my new car! Ha!

Damn she headed butted da shit out of dat nigga. #SuperBowl  commercial

Toyota commercial disturbing  Greek yogurt was funny #superbowl

I LOVE IT!!! #Toyota selling cars without showing a car! #SUPERBOWL #commercial

Damn she head butt the fuck outta that man #Superbowl LMAO

That's what I've always wanted to do to John Stamos. #superbowl

Who was that man lip-syncing and dancing in a black skirt during theSuperbowl halftime show? #madonnachesthair #superbowl

Fiat & yogurt (brand?) commercials have been the best. #SuperBowl

sorry, had to make/eat dinner. did I miss anything? #brandbowl #superbowl

Didn't realise plays 4 da Pats!!! Guess my view of the #superbowl has changed

All this delicious food my mom Makes (: #Superbowl

My fav ad so far is  for The Voice with Betty White.  She's so funny.   #SuperBowl #HalfTime

How many more cokes are these soon to be diabetic polar bears gonna fuckin drink?. #SuperBowl

That'll be sarcasm buddy. Enjoying the game. #SuperBowl

I think we should get the monday after the #SuperBowl off from school.. RT if you agree

Oh yeah yogurt! I'd do the same Screw you No one gets between me and my yogurt! #SuperBowl

I love how Danon's definitive idea of Greece is John Stamos. #superbowl

What is Coke going to do for their #SuperBowl ads when global warming makes polar bears go extinct?

Dirty Harry almost made my day! #SuperBowl

These #superbowl spots continue to be pretty damn sad and disappointing

I love #Greekyogurt enough to head butt John stamos too #superbowl #superbowlxlvi

Deion need to be shot for wearing that jacket in the 21st century commercial #SuperBowl

#superbowl = excuse to make banana crumb muffins

Chilli dogs, nachos, sour cream, beer and more chilli.. And, oh yeah FOOOOOOOOTTBAALLL!!!!! Come on GIANTS!!! #SuperBowl #gogiants

How many frikkin' timeouts do they have?#SuperBowl

Yes!!! Go New England!!!! #SuperBowl With my friends & family :)

LOL Yep M.I.A. & Minaj ALL 'bout that mighty #superbowl  paper! #TheGame

O yea get JPP out of here #superbowl

Tom Brady : 16 consecutive completions Superbowl record #superbowl

Indianapolis looks awesome. Love the kudos it's getting! #SuperBowl

Football is a ritualized simulation of war. Meanwhile, in Syria  #superbowl #syria #peace

It's ok. The trainers are down with JPP. #SuperBowl #yeahyouknowme

From Uncle Jessie to yogurt commercials. No wonder Rebecca left him #superbowl

For those of us watching online (because we don't have cable), these #RainnWilson ads are PAINFULLY unfunny. Every time. #superbowl #nbc

who's still awake? the number of adverts are taking the absolute piss #Superbowl

Deion has to do Century 21 ads? How much is Pilar getting? #superbowl

THAT BITCH JUST HEADBUTTED UNCLE JESSE! #superbowl #commercial

Why Is Everyone Licking Madonna Ass She Was Wank That Wheel Barrow Kick Did It For Me #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl #BrandBowl #MadonnaBowl TYGA - RACK CITY (SUPERBOWL REMIX) BY  TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK :) #TFB

Pierre-Paul injury Would hate this to be the game changer. #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl

Ya know, the fact the economy went down the shitter really improved the quality of the #SuperBowl commercials. #LOL

If Seinfeld would've busted out the pony line I would've enjoyed it more #SuperBowl #NFL #FireAndyReid

Pats offence isn't give Giants defense anytime off field #superbowl

ACURA NSX HAS COME BACK YEAH #superbowl commercial #nsx

okay that acura looks nice as fuck, but those are expensive to keep up. parts n stuff. :/ #superbowl

I'd never attack you for some yogurt, uncle Jesse. #brandbowl #superbowl

#superbowl #halftimeshow after seeing Madonna I'm done watching the game. Water for elephants or pirates 4??

Woo-hoo! The return of Seinfeld jokes! LOVE IT. #superbowl

FACT: #Chevy has officially reached the negative reach / over-frequency bar in their tax-dollar bought #Superbowl pelting

Who is John Carter? Tim Riggins. #SuperBowl #FNL

Leno sucks. Still not over that Conan thing. #superbowl #adbowl

Jay Leno ruined that commercial . But he's used to ruining things  #SuperBowl #SB46

That tweets about good causes during the #superbowl puts it into perspective. #superbowl

I doubt that the Dannon Greek yogurt is worth headbutting Uncle Jesse over. #SuperBowl #Commercials

my prediction might even be right!! #unlikely #superbowl

Who cares about the superbowl #notme commercials and halftime show is what its about #fuckinfootball #superbowl

The key number for #NBC is $112million viewers and tonight's #SuperBowl will be the most watched #TVShow of all time.

I'm glad to see Jay Leno able to pick up a little extra cash a few times tonight. I'm sure he's feeling the pinch like everyone. #SuperBowl

sure. But I'm not a big fan of lame commercials. :) #superbowl

Have you noticed all the ads in the #SuperBowl tonight promoting American manufacturing?

I heart Jerry Seinfeld. And God bless the revival of the Soup Nazi. #NFL, #superbowl

I wish we could see the #Superbowl commercials. :(  #canadianproblems

This year #SuperBowl commercials been mad whack !

Acura & Seinfeld definitely have the best #superbowl commercial thus far.

Why can't commercials be this d*mn funny everyday? #superbowl

how much does #jerryseinfeld get paid for #SuperBowl commercials?

I don't understand how people are paying attention to commercials in a game like this! #SUPERBOWL #PatriotsNation

Good Seinfeld #superbowl ad (w/ alien for a paranormal angle) but the longer version online is better. Check it out

hey I FINALLY found a working #superbowl live stream over at  Time to drink! RT this please!

Please GOD let Kristen Wiig do a parody of Madoonna's Halftime Show on #SNL this Saturday #superbowl--yaaaasss lawd!

Did Aaron Hernandez open up a vault in his #SuperBowl celebration?

My boy just called the England #SuperBowlXLVI commentary team 2 stooges and a reject. Looool #SuperBowl

waiting till the game comes on to go to the bathroom #superbowl #superbowlcommercials

that awesome (and terrible) thing is happening where i eat an entire pizza by myself. #superbowl

Super Bowl party with and some unnamed winners. #NYGiants #SuperBowl #Madonna is trending

Acura NSX looks like a flippin' concept carfyaaaaahhhh!!! #superbowl

Note to GEthe #SuperBowl is not a time for INTELLIGENT commercials!!

GE Worksgreat then start paying your corporate taxes. #SuperBowl #p2

Want to reinvent America, Try paying taxes here. #SuperBowl #notbuyingit

Best episode yet.. reminds me it's a commercial Dammit #seinfeld #superbowl

You gotta luv football games like dis cause its still anybodys game, this is what make a superbowl party a party #SuperBowl

#Toyota does even better. Without even using gratuitous sex. #superbowl

I hope the NY GIANTS take this victory #SuperBowl #Swag

While everyone else in the world is watching the #SuperBowl, I'm cleaning the bathroom.

I laughed till I cried at the Oikos yogurt #commercial #superbowl

Another injury timeout. Coughlin's scowl just broke his jaw. #superbowl #lateshowwriters

Like a Prayer is trending - World Peace, not so much - if that doesn't tell you about the future, nothing will #SuperBowl

I'm not going to lie. I missed the half time show. #SuperBowl

Good ball game so far! Not actually needed any coffee.yet! #Superbowl

Finally my US proxy paid off, I'm impressed by NBC Sports coverage online with the different camera angles & US #superbowl spots!

Nice commercial Toyota but Acura threw more stars at it though. Still lame. #superbowl #adbowl #teamad

Just when I was beginning to think #superbowl ads didnt bring the funny this year, the second half steps up. #Fiat, #seinfeldleno

And like that, Acura's website goes down after airing their new NSX commercial during the #SuperBowl.

I haven't seen a High Low since Tag Team Wrestling. Take that back UMvC3 Fuzzy Guards.  #SUPERBOWL

Thanks to these #Superbowl commercials I now know that every company has a factory.

Leno & Seinfeld's Acura NSX #SuperBowl Commercial ---- Priceless, until someone gets the bill!

flying squirrel jetpack suit#superbowl   (FTW.  Go Jay Leno)

I don't appreciate the amount of chin we've seen during these #superbowl commercials

My iphone appears to have croaked. Too much #superbowl messaging

#SuperBowl party spread! I'm not a #Madonna fan but that show was off. the. chain!

Still waiting for Ferris Bueller. #SuperBowl commercials let down so far.

He was chasing the play from behind Haha #superbowl

Looking back, I should not have done acid/ magic mushrooms at halftime. I'm having the worst second half. #BadTrip #SuperBowl

So far I have kept my word by not watching this #Giant and #Patriots #superbowl. I'd be more interested in the commercials this year. #NFL

LOL'd at #JohnStamos - new technique to try as my bf continues to eff with me during this #SuperBowl.. His nose isn't as durable #BrandBowl

Pats offensive line is doing as amazing job #SuperBowl

Good to see Glasgow well represented in the #superbowl. #Tynes

While y'all are tweetin about the #SuperBowl, Im gonna tweet about more important things like the fact that I dont have to be up at 5 tmrw!

NY Giants are, on average, 2.73 inches taller than the Patriots. #superbowl

The only thing worse than a boring #Superbowl commercial is a boring #Superbowl  commercial you've already seen.

The only thing good about the super bowl is the half time show and the football players ass's #SuperBowl

#Superbowl commentator chap just said #HowDyaLikeDemApples what a ledge!

Loved the commercial by Dodge with Clint Eastwood narrating. It PUMPED me up! It's halftime America; Love that thought! #SuperBowl

I pretty much watch the #SuperBowl for the commercials

It just got very loud on that play then, even louder when Brady was sacked! #SuperBowl #NFLonsky

Ooooohhh, I saw a #Browns logo during the #superbowl

Hakeem Knicks Got F'ed Up By Chung In The #SuperBowl

That's a huge play for the Giants! (That's right, I can talk about the game too) #superbowl

such a low scoring game what is this, hockey?! #amirite #superbowl

Tuck had a mini #BookerT hand gesture going there #WWE #SuperBowl #NFL #NYC #Giants

Score is 17-12 at the #superbowl. Am I the only one who thought of Acadia?  #itsatrenchthing

#SuperBowl It can't be fun to be clobbered by a cat who weigh about three bills. Brady needs a hug.

Oikos Yogurt has a funny commercial #superbowl //   It was hilarious !! LOL

I love how popular Betty White is, you go girl! She made the ending for that promo on The Voice. #superbowl

Seriously #Coke? Polar bears and penguins? Opposite ends of the world #SuperBowl

Is Lemon Merengue Pie #superbowl dessert? I think so

Was Madonna calling for world peace or giving a shout out to the NBA small forward formerly known as Ron Artest? #MettaWorldPeace #SuperBowl

my homework and the #superbowl is competing for my attentionthe #superbowl is deff winning.

#Superbowl coverage in CanadaTHE WORST EVER. Can't watch the good commercials, no we have to watch BMO crap, or A&W. CTV, you suck big

Damn, Madonna. I hope I look that good when I'm an 86 year old man too. #superbowl

I'm Not Going To Bed At 4am For Nothing! Giants Better Win -__- #SuperBowl

Have a break, have a cup cake. #SuperBowl #XLVI

Tuck's bow reminds me of Shredder. I miss #TMNT #SuperBowl

I want to see my  in the #superbowl next year!

OK, so the ads are getting better. Seinfeld and Eastwood were really good. But let's take a break from polar bears, shall we? #superbowl

We liked the commercial- they've done a good job two #SuperBowl's in a row.

Madonna #superbowl  WASTE OFF TIME & MONEY!!!! Rather watch paint dry SERIOUSLY!!!!

Aight STFU about the #superbowl. If I wanted to know whats going I would watch it!!!!!

Ah helloits the #superbowl #mediacom. That's ok, we didn't really want to watch it.

Diggin' the Seinfeld Acura ad! No soup for you!! #soupnatzi #superbowl

im surprised you're on twitter if your only just starting to watch the #superbowl

Finally a #browns mention during the #superbowl!  Too bad it was about a team that played 200 years ago!!!

So basically Massachusetts deserves yet ANOTHER national title. After the #SuperBowl we'll take home the crown- Miss America '13

watching #BookOfEli instead of the #SuperBowl: after todays sermon fr. at on #Success & #Sincerity - I am inspired !!!

did you just hear Finch in the #Superbowl #booyahhhhh old school

I wanna touchdown your bootie 3 #poetuit #superbowl

Wonder what #Conan thinks about all these #Leno #SuperBowl cameos?

RT via The Huddle - Homage to the first #SuperBowl  #Design #Illustration

can't beat a bit of Mellow Magic of a night. A bit of Luther to get you to sleep. Tonight it's #superbowl though instead ha.

Did they just use Finch to cut to commercial??? #drivethrurecords #superbowl

I wish they would let or make a #SuperBowl halftime appearance sometime! #WishfulThinking

Wow that guy was dressed like shredder out of the turtles. #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl

It's hard to keep up w it all. I'm just going to wait for tomorrow's round-up of the best tweets about the shittiest #SuperBowl commericals.

Jealous of people state side for them watching the #SuperBowl  an it not being 1:48 am

#SuperBowl GO GIGANTS!!! GO GO GO!!!!!!!!

Welp that was the most recognition the Browns will get at a #Superbowl game. When reviewing past records. #istillloveohio

Shouldn'tsomebodygo..check..onMadonna? She may have to gnaw her arm off to get out that hole #superbowl #41days

3rd quarter and Patriots are in the lead!!! We are the best! :D #NFL #Superbowl

I really wanna say FUCK the #SuperBowl right now but I wanna be respectful to those who actually waited all season for this

I love these retrospective ads from #Budweiser. #SuperBowl

Never forget. The best halftime show. Ever. #SuperBowl

Not at all impressed with halftime Black Eyed Peas were way better last year!!!!! #halftime #superbowl

Catching up on the #Superbowl adsLove Betty, M&M one is funnyJohn Stamos one made me laugh..Love the doggy doritos one

#superbowl budweiser ads is fun and the music in it is cryzy 8/10 #sportment

I wanna see the ad w/ Andre 3000 & Adrien Brody again. thank goodness for the Internet. #Gillette #SuperBowl  #brandbowl

#superbowl ain't for me I'm gonna sleep instead

Ahem.  Budweiser is a Belgian company now.  Stop with the American Flag Budweiser commercials.  #SuperBowl  #BuySamAdams

Did everyone catch the Finch song going into this #superbowl commercial break???

Wat Is Der To Enjoy?!?!?!? We Already Seen Dis Fuckin #Superbowl

Or you could try brewing good beer, which advertises itself. #Budweiser #SuperBowl

Mid-size Nissan Frontier plowing down the ski hill!  That was a great commercial!  #SuperBowl

What's up with the commercial? A history of partying?! #brandbowl #superbowl

Best thing about this #superbowl party is the #chickenwings what about yours??

Tim Duncan and Steve Nash made it into a commercial. And it wasn't bad.  #win #superbowl #bridgestone

Things I learned from Bud: End of prohibition = End of war = Man walk on moon #SuperBowl

Who's watching the #puppybowl on animal planet?? LOOOL so funny. But its #superbowl nite

#SuperBowl Drinking Game: Baby! Drink up!

Best commercial so far has been the flashback one for Budweiser . #grabsomebuds  #superbowl

The GOP would like to rename the Greek yogurt to evil socialist yogurt. #SuperBowl

Hey #budweiser not that many people from Kentucky have a tv to watch your #superbowl commercials so stop with crappy beer ads

Aw I really liked the historical bud commercials :) they make me happy! #superbowl

good thing it's about the game. #SuperBowl

i take bathroom breaks during the game, not the commercials #superbowl

high school musical when the #superbowl is actually playing, and flipping for the commercials, haha lifesguud

When did Bridgestone get a HUGE pot of $$$ to pay for athlete endorsements? Wowza. #superbowl

Make sure yaw tune in to that #superbowl commercial with the flying Grey Goose bottles

Is it wrong that I want to see Steve Nash dribble that baby? #probablyso #SuperBowl

Disclaimer: I don't care for commercials in general, but it seems like #SuperBowl commercials have gotten way more lame over the yrs!

Bud/Bud Light.dropped the ball this year.   #SuperBowl  #commercials

Tuck looks pretty intimidating in that Hannibal Lecter mask. #superbowl

How does Tom Brady manage to look like a zombie in all his pics? He's beautiful! #superbowl

Good contest so far. Not too impressed with ads. Madonna was decent at half time. #Superbowl

Good Game so far #Giants vs #Patriots #SuperBowl

Somehow I think the experience would be different if the Saints were in the Game! #Superbowl

I'm surprised Madonna didn't try to adopt Cee Lo Green before the half-time show. #youknowwhatsheslike #SuperBowl #halftimeshow

Grab a fork, and watch a proper sport rather than #SuperBowl shite #youknowitmakessense

For a second, thought I saw you on the #SuperBowl half-time stage playing keyboards/etc with #Madonna. But I

Echo & #Bunnymen, #TheCult soundtrack #SuperBowl commercials. Watch 'em both:

Budweiser.  Getting less relevant as we breath.  The ad implies Bud was ever cool.  Old man factory beer at best.  #superbowl #adworkers

Thanks #NFL 4 finally giving # Browns credit that was something be4 #Superbowl

#Superbowl observations: dan patrick has gotten old; madonna is reduced to cheerleader.. for herself; why is jay leno in

Brady injured on that last sack?  Looked like that hurt.  #Pats #NFL #SuperBowl

Watching ads on One HD, with the #Superbowl playing in the breaks

the #superbowl ends at 4am i have to be up at 6am. is it really worth it? of course its worth it, its the #superbowl

Did someone throw water on Madonna? It looked like she melted at the end of the halftime show #superbowl

Does Tuck have five bars on his face mask? I bet he gets great cell reception. #SuperBowl

going back and forth watching the #SuperBowl and a snake eat a rat.really fucking cool!

Good for Century 21,  they are trying to breakout in a cluttered field, and it is a great start  #superbowl #brandbowl

I'm going to mention the wrong sport. #superbowl

Some women are having KIDS in their 40s AND 50s naturally people ok! Yeah, stop the age bullshit, its so not a factor xD! #Superbowl #truth

Excellent commercial from Budweiser. Great ad concept. #SuperBowl #superbowlcommercial #budweiser

Bridgestone bringing everyone outta retirement. Oh wait does Tim Duncan still play-lol #superbowl

hola I FINALLY found a working #superbowl stream over at  Let's get crunk! RT this please!

Which team is winning? Me, because I'm not watching. #SuperBowl

I've noticed the #Superbowl ad tweets have died down in second half. Did we tweeters blow all our hate on Madonna?

Acura junta Jerry Seinfeld e Jay Leno  #SuperBowl

fine I admit..I didn't even know who was in the #superbowl til this morning & decided to root 4 the Giants by flipping a coin.

Like the last Bud and Bridgestone commercials. #Superbowl

#SuperBowl love the look on Steve Nash's on Bridgestone's commercial.

Justin Tucks facemask makes him look like a Deceptacon #superbowl..cool eh

Oh PLEASE let Brady be injured! #Superbowl #BooHoo

RT studies show people who play golf get the same brain damage as people who play American Football #SuperBowl

Im guessing everyone awake is watching #superbowl

I'm one of the few people on twitter that's not watching what everyone else is .. #superbowl

I'm a sucker for a good Seinfeld commercial. #lovehim #SuperBowl

the Cult. Flor ida. War ends. Budweiser. Good commercial. #superbowl

When #lmfao came out and tried to break Madonna's hip, that was my favorite part of #Superbowl 2012 #sexyngeriatric

Why did Madonna have to screw with the Giants mind set!!!! #superbowl

Next year id rather watch janets nip slip on repeat than that trainwreck again..and I cant stand janet #superbowl

Hang on to the ball! You are being paid millions of dollars to do that!  #SuperBowl

Super Bowl Half Time show - from eonline! #superbowl #halftimeshow

Basketball commercial during the #SuperBowl. Umm okay :)

I'm shocked the coaches are using iPads. Clipboards are so outdated. #superbowl

This Tom Brady fellow seems familiar I think he played in my corporate softball league a few years ago. #SuperBowl

Sweet Heavens #Nicks just scared this piss outta me. #superbowl

Patriots need to hold the Giants with this momentum. #superbowl

Marcus Bachmann is still doing that Madonna dance routine back home in Minnesota. #SuperBowl

Remember when beer commercials were funny and creative? Now it's just trendy douchebags hanging out in clubs.#SuperBowl

This is the one time I actually wish i understood football #SuperBowl

#Lol to John stamos getting knocked out #superbowl

Dear Giants: DO NOT SCARE ME LIKE THAT!!! #Superbowl

#JerrySeinfeld had the BEST #superbowl #commercial!!! Had to rewind & watch again! :)

Nothing makes Twitter blow up with a collective OOPS! than the resounding thud of a ball punch. #SuperBowl

That Clint Eastwood commercial was the best one of the whole Super Bowl.  He gets my vote anyway! #SuperBowl

Budweiser may win the battle for best production with its Eternal Optimism ad, great stuff, well done. #adbowl #superbowl

y mientras mi hermano ve sex and the city, yo veo el #superbowl! jajaja #chistosoelasunto jajaj

Football, Commercials, Halftime. When are you supposed to per? #superbowl

#TheCult just got disrespected with trashy commercial. Warning: So not touch the Classics! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlXLVII

Best thing bout #superbowl is that it means less than a month till pitchers and catchers report #fb #mlb #braves

Is it just me or has there been a lot of shoving this game??  #Superbowl

What did you guys think of Madonna's #Superbowl halftime outfit??? Love it or hate it?

The only time i scream at people for being too loud during commercials is the Super Bowl!!! #SuperBowl

Madonna was great, but I still think Prince in 2007 was best half time show ever #superbowl #halftimeshow

Haha. Collective cheers then sigh here on that fumble.#superbowl

Madonna was a member of the cheerleading team at Rochester Adams High School just like today in the #SuperBowl -

heres to make up for the halftime.. thing  #superbowl #kissarmy #creep

#SuperBowl The Giants are REALLY lucky that Hynoski recovered.

I love the performance of madonna, like a player, in the #superbowl 2012

Luckily for him, Hakeem Nicks got bailed out from becoming Kyle Williams #SuperBowl

3rd year in a row is blocking #SuperBowl on my HDTV VF551XVT

Tom Brady just took a hard shot, landing on his left shoulder. #SuperBowl

#superbowl I never thought I'd hear #thecult on a #budwiser commercial .

The NFL should just have celebrity lookalikes doing karaoke at halftime. NBC's had some pretty good choices for bumper music tho! #superbowl

There is no question that #Madonna is still one of the most prolific performers of our time. #superbowl

Madonna is ageless! She #murked that #SuperBowl halftime show! Loved the accompaniments #NickiMinaj #M.I.A #Ceelo

Looks like this #superbowl is going to come down to the last drive, tight gameBEST commercial M&M naked candies make me laugh

#superbowl would be better if a) the players were hotter b)there were more fights c) the eagles were playing

With a name like Henry Hynoski you have 3 career options: butcher, automotive assembly line, or NFL fullback. #SuperBowl

My 5 year old nephew just told me his penis's name was Charlie and that his balls were named Sponge and Bob #superbowl

Look at that Akron boy lay the wood! #superbowl #hitstick #zips #nfl

idk now how yall sit here and watch dudes throw a football back in forth for hours!!!#ImNotHip #SuperBowl

Madonnas made such a twat of herself when she nearly fell over ahhhh #superbowl

#RonArtest = #world peace you got your name in #NFL #superbowl #halftime  show!

The #Patriots of the regular season is starting to rear its head again. #SuperBowl

Maybe that's why women don't play in the NFL, so their weight isn't posted on national television.  #SuperBowl

A million women are hating the Giants' D after Brady got hit so hard. #SuperBowl #justdonttouchhisface

I miss the American Express commercials Jerry Seinfeld did with Superman. #SuperBowl

If it wasn't for rock music of the last 30 years, rappers would have to create their own music to back up their wack lyrics.  #SuperBowl

Missing the #superbowl can't believe this television in #LatinAmerica #Honduras I don't want the latin #espn

Watching the #SuperBowl with my brother's roommates, Grant, Tiffany, Morgan, and Carl :))

People are saying that #Madonna sang live . umm  we're not talking about when she originally recorded the songs! #SuperBowl

Anyone know what the MHK is on Brady's jersey?  #SuperBowl

yes, the 00's and now were so dead looking. Are you saying USA is dead Bud #superbowl # brandbowl

Madonna = original hipster. She was eating fetus stem cells before it was cool. #superbowl

Ryan Mallet gon get some playing time. Lmao. #SuperBowl

Eat some of that Hoosier salad, Brady. Go Giants! #SuperBowl

#superbowl half time show #madonna #cirquedusoleil, amazing show. Go Pats, even if I love the Giants! :)

Does anyone find the many ads interesting? How can something that insipid have cost so much? Yawn. #Brandbowl #Superbowl

Top ads voted by people at our party - M&Ms, Doritos, Chrysler Clint, eTrade, Yellow Camaro #superbowl #commercial

To be honest, I'm only watching the #SuperBowl just to see the commercial.  #Samsung

Dont even care that i have college tomorrow. I'm watching this game! #Superbowl #PATRIOTS

#giants vs. #patriots #superbowl party! Tight game right now! Big hits!

All I asked for was Like A Prayer. Vogue was an added bonus, and I'm so happy Madonna shuffled. #superbowl #madonna

#superbowl What's the worst halftime show you've ever seen?

No tweets about the Stamos commercial because it wasn't a cameo. He auditioned for it. #superbowl

Obama #SuperBowl Sit-Down: He Says He Deserves Second Term  via  Wall St

How about them Patriots?! Let's gooooooooo!!! #SuperBowl

You could be watching the #SuperBowl on an #iPad2 right now! Enter to win one before the #Oscars from

Wondering if the #SuperBowl is actually even happening. Did Indianapolis get hit too?

Do football players somehow know when the camera is on them so they can spit? #SuperBowl

The only time I want to watch the #SuperBowl, they want to watch something else grr!

Know I might get mad hate for this but I can't stand Tom Brady I just don't like him  #superbowl

#superbowl Does Bud think we drink beer because of history and tradition?

#Patriots sack Manning. Guess some D# showed up to play. #SuperBowl

I'm soooo over the #SuperBowl but there's nothing good to watch on tv!!!

I wonder what America would rather see: Madonna playing qb or Brady doing the halftime show? #superbowl #wouldyourather

So glad to see someone FINALLY head-butt John Stamos. #Superbowl #XLVI

#Madonna already blowing The Black Eyes out of the water #superbowl #halftimeshow

#FWParty I like the Bud #Superbowl commercials, why? Because it's #StLouis #Stl finest

Hmmm - We're inches away from the endzone, think I'll run directly into the biggest guy on the team #SuperBowl

This game is boring, can we get the skycam to fall again?  Or the power to go out again? #superbowl #lxchat

I find the 3 downs in the #CFL makes for more exciting football. Just saying. #Superbowl #NFL

Fiat should stop making cars and start producing porn. #superbowl

Finally figured out why I don't like the ads this year - at least 1/2 of them are for cars or beer, neither of which I buy. #SuperBowl #sb46

I really didn't hate the Bud commercial actually #SuperBowl

Wow. More people tune in for #madonna than #Superbowl . #trending#RIPMadonna

VIDEO: Duncan Keith, and others discuss the #Blackhawks problems after practice on #SuperBowl Sunday

Does #SuperBowl really need to be promoted on Twitter today?

33 yd FG by Tynes good.  Patriots 17, Giants 15, :35 left 3rd Quarter.  #superbowl

Anyone got prop bet going on the number of times the camera will cut to brady spitting? #Superbowl

This ad is pretty sweet. The car is awesome too :) Maya Larry #superbowl

Homoerotic 300 and Madonna. A truly macho #superbowl half time show.

Come on giants!!! You can get back up there :~) #SuperBowl

U know U sexy! Playin #humble! U can perform as good as Madonna too tho the pelvic thrusts may be much for church. #SuperBowl

Used to love football Now its too hyped up, I can't even enjoy the #superbowl this year. (N)

suddenly remembered y i havent botherd 2watch an NFL game since about 2009? #Superbowl ..not worth bags under my eyes #Goodnight #overandout

By far the quickest #SuperBowl I've ever watched

Madonna's half-time show: Great choreography as usual, but seemed kind of lackluster or maybe it's just me. #SB46 #SuperBowl

I'm trying to care, I really am, but my brain refuses to retain the images. #SuperBowl

Is it just me or does the narrator not really sound like George Clooney  #Toyota #camry #superbowl

Got picked up early. Idunno who wins :c #Superbowl

Good to see Eli Manning throw as many touchdowns in Indy this year as Payton did so far. #Superbowl #GoPats

Giants field goal good Pats 17 - 15 #superbowl

Guys at this bar  have a bet for first Tebow mention. Remains uncollected.  #reactlabs, #superbowl

Think it is funny reading the tweets, by the Brits, on the #superbowl.

I've just remembered that I've actually PLAYED American Football before. Still don't have a fucking clue what's going on. #superbowl

Damn, there's two points in it now. Go #superbowl

The US #Superbowl commercial tweets are making me jealous. Wish we could see them here in Canada :(

Kick is good, add three points to cut score 17-15. #SuperBowl

Had a great service tonight! :)Got baptized! :) I feel pure! Now ima watch them pats do work!! #christian #saved #SuperBowl

So tonight the Patriots are facing the Giants? #superbowl

Brady could really do with going to bed, he's got terrible bags under his eyes #SuperBowl

Poor 3rd down conversion from #Giants atm. #Eli will have expected a TD on that last drive #Superbowl

SACK! Number three. Nice. Now for the fourth quarter #Patriots #superbowl

Well it took the #SuperBowl, but I finally tried #Shazam.

Finally tuning into the #SuperBowl. Just realising why the Giants fans on my TL have gone from flooding to not even a trickle.

I'm off to bed now but before I go let's just start this trending #giantscomeback #Superbowl #bbcsuperbowl

When are they FINALLY gonna get Meatloaf to do the #SuperBowl Halftime Show???

If my #Redskins would have made it to the #Superbowl , they would've made me proud !

Yoooooo, Tom Brady looks like a Chucky doll! #superbowl

This #Superbowl game is actually exciting. One team is going home crying after this.

In other news, Eli Manning's facial expression hasn't changed all game. #SuperBowl #NMAtv

The history you know is wrong, ancient Egypt was filled with cheerleaders. / LOL (via #superbowl #halftimeshow

We need the number of finger-licks by Brady this game! #Patriots #SuperBowl

#superbowl #SB46 you must get a TD when you're in red zone not sure you can continue to stop Brady after a good quarter still under 2 points

So people say some pointless ass shit, who cares what you don't like.  #SuperBowl

Oh boy here we go crunch time c'mon giants!!!!! #BigBluePride #NYG #SuperBowl #gottabelieve

Best #SuperBowl ad so far? Jump over to our live blog and tell us!

Do you think that black facepaint really matters in a dome? #superbowl

It's amazing how long a football game feels when you don't care for either team. #superbowl

Last quarter, and it's anyones game! Ahhhh #SuperBowl Bring it home #Patriots!!!

No word yet whether Vince Wilfork's cousin, Prince Wilspoon, is in attendance at tonight's #SuperBowl.

Really enjoying the #SuperBowl tonight. Impressed with #Indianapolis and the caliber of commercials.

Hang on to your saddles, it's getting crazy #SuperBowl

You know damned well aint nothing new on #SuperBowl Sunday!

So mitt is pulling for the pats and newt for the giants? that makes this game somewhat more interesting..#superbowl

I think Jay-Z & Beyonce should have bought a #SuperBowl commercial spot to (cont)

#superbowl wasted with she has to work tomorrow bwhahhahaha

Tried to watch the #SuperBowl but the only that I loved about it was the exclusive ads.

Another big break for the Giants there. Recover Bradshaw fumble. #SuperBowl

An interception by pats d and run in for td would be nice#superbowl

Yeah, how many people listen to #reggae while watching the #superbowl?? We do!!

Great effort, and a great interception by Chase Blackburn!! #superBOWL

I'm back. Tom Brady basically punted one to within the 10. Only difference is that he didn't kick it this time. #superbowl

Yes! Bueller for the win! You kids will never know. #superbowl

Hope all our fans are enjoying the #superbowl . It's getting interesting #America !

Let's take this game into overtime and make #SuperBowl history #SB46

my five year old cousin just told me he pooped in the tuband the other one keeps calling himself banditt man #wow #noclue.. #superbowl

Drink every time there is a random celebrity in a #SuperBowl commercial.

Ferries bueller commercial. Because old things are always better twenty years later. #superbowl #Matthewbroderick

Hoping there's a place where I can just watch the commercials for the #superbowl tmw.

Meet one Udo Lindenberg with another one to meet. Der #SuperBowl-Werbeblues

David Beckham Bodywear for H&M #SuperBowl Ad - YouTube

Just a random fact, Madonna is older than the #SuperBowl

Classic  RT if you think #Madonna is rockin' it! #SuperBowl

I agree R Clint Eastwood +Chrysler. Pretty effective commercial. Should have been sponsored by Obama reelection team. #superbowl

is the most enthusiastic fan I've ever watched a game with lol #Respect #TeamBrady #SuperBowl

Even Donovan McNabb thinks too many balls are bouncing for the #Giants #SuperBowl

Man the ads suck on the Superbowl in Canada. #Superbowl

For some reason I have a need to see #FerrisBeuhlersDayOff .classic #NFL #SuperBowl

Tom Brady's hail Mary was intercepted because he's not Tim Tebow. #SuperBowl

Hey Giants, pretend you're in prison. If you keep fumbling stuff, you're going to get fucked hard! #SuperBowl #SB46

From Tamil Tiger to Corporate-Sponsored Madonna Cheerleader: The M.I.A. Story. #WTF #SuperBowl #doesntmakeitanybetterthatshegavethefinger

Oh so two commercials I likedThe Voice. Love me some Betty White and the flower one with Adriana Lima. Suggestive. #superbowl

Patsies are playing dirty. What do you expect, their coach is Beli-cheat. #SuperBowl

I've liked Mary-Louise Parker since Fried Green Tomatoes, thru West Wing, WeedsI hate that she did an ad for TimeWarnerCable. #superbowl

Ok, when's the Ferris Bueller sequel? I'd watch it. #SuperBowl

11 dollars of squares and I won 15 so far! Not bad!! #superbowl #squares

Bueller ad anticlimactic in shortened version and after already being released online#SuperBowl

Is it over yet? I'm ready for bed. #Superbowl #toomuchguac

Blackburn just made the kind of play that wins Superbowls. #Tyreeondefense #sb46

Ferris Bueller redux in LA and not Chicago?  Lame!  #SuperBowl

If You At A #SuperBowl Party Right Now & The T.V. Is Rope Off, That Means That T.V. Is Going Back To Rental-A-Center Tomorrow!

Here's to making the next century safer! #superbowl #concussion

Great Grape Ape on a #Superbowl ad! EPIC!

It cracks me up, all these side line coaches I'm around #SuperBowl

house is packed. everyone is drunk. and the BBQ is delicious. #superbowl

Volton AND Fat Albert in the same ad! #SuperBowl #NFL #CoolAd

Ferris Bueller is gettin' on up there LoL #superbowl

Honda/ Ferris Beuller commercial was good, but not #winning #superbowl

Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop to look around one in a while you could miss it # FerrisBueller #SuperBowl

I have eaten WAAAAYYYY too much. Ugh. #superbowl

These #superbowl commercials aren't really impressing me this year

MIA flashes middle finger and cusses during halftime showoh let the insanity begin! #superbowl #nextyearbringbackjanetsboob

Yo if your on twitter  #SuperBowl hating. STFUUUUUU LOL just dont watch the game or log off! Fvck off my TL tho lol

These Giants must be eating Lucky Charms. The balls continue to fall their way or do not get intercepted. #SuperBowl

Just looked at the sky planner #SuperBowl  finishes at 4 o'clock. Are you taking the piss now

All commercials need more Voltron. #Superbowl

Yeah, but we all saw it last weekI like 2 be s'prised #bueller #brandbowl #superbowl #justsayin

#honda crv does not equal a ferris bueller ferrari, but the spot was still a good one! #brandbowl #superbowl

How far do you like #Madonna's #Superbowl performance? Watch again here at new fansite

Go #GMen!!! Did you see that pick?!?! If my COLTS aren't in it, I'm going for the home team!!! #superbowl

Love watching the #SuperBowl. You can get so much work done around the house with all these commercials. Am I right?

Voltron in a MetLife commercial - way to bring back a great child memory! #superbowl

BIG play by Blackburn, who makes an interception! But Bradshaw stalls the Giants momentum with a fumble #SuperBowl

Billicheck (sp?) even wears his cut-off hoodie to the #superbowl. What a slob.

Giants to take it I reckon mate. Tynne with a late field goal #Superbowl

Ok I was in the kitchen is #8mile coming out in #3D or something? #Superbowl

MetLife should be ashamed of marketing their products to children. #Superbowl #adbowl

I seriously have 13 more mins of this? okay. I'll just wait for the morning news recap of the commercials I miss. G'night #superbowl

Watching the #Superbowl and #House consecutively because the breaks are getting too much

WHERE IS THE VOLKSWAGON IMPERIAL MARCH COMMERCIAL?! #SuperBowl

Everybody is obsessing about the half time show. Shout out to for nailing the National Anthem! #superbowl

I can only imagine how much a spot for a 17seconds commercial costs during #SuperBowl

hi Jim! I'm digging commercial, though #BrandBowl #Superbowl

#RushLimnaugh in Pats box, #EricCantor in the Giants.   Do team owners ever invite anyone who's not an asshole?  #superbowl

The appearance of Voltron in that MetLife commercial has, for me, been the most exciting part of this #superbowl

From reading Twitter, I gather that there are two teams in this year's Superbowl. #superbowl

Love how we can press a red button and watch live Hockey! #superbowl

Is it just me or is the #superbowl taking over Aus tweets? Well, at least the ads, Madonna & LMFAO. Partially successful US sport invasion?

I have faith in the NY Giants. They will win this #Superbowl - Just don't ask me the score. --   // overtime would be cool.

MetLife wins!!! You can't include that many different cartoon characters and not win. #superbowl

Get fit #Vancouver!! Can't watch the #Superbowl and not be motivated visalusvancouver.myvi.net

I was just wondering the same thing. They don't make the #SuperBowl commercials like they used to.

Just watched Madonna again at #superbowl  half time she reclaim her throne as the Queen #oneandonlymadonna

#Superbowl, easy we didnt do crap at work even though supposed to be the busiest day of the year(pizza) hmm SMH

71 million lbs of avocados are consumed for the #Superbowl They were all picked by 12 Guatemalans who were paid 24 cents. Enjoy your guac.

no one gives a fuck about who you want to win. #SuperBowl

god, i love the e-trade babies hahahahhaa #superbowl

Let's go #PATRIOTS keep the lead and we're okay #SuperBowl is wearing me out

Giants burned two time-outs, fourth quarter of the #superbowl and a close game. Could come back to haunt em

So you lose a time out and still get a five yarder. Giants Fail.  #SuperBowl

Greatest #SuperBowl commercial. Ever. Awesome job

Better commercials-Bud, Hyundai, Met Life. Giants want this one #SuperBowl

I worked on Honda. Great #Superbowl ad  (not biased)! Matthew Broderick: Why I Agreed to  #FerrisBueller Ad.  #blinkwink

Oh hello other bestfriend (: I love #SuperBowl Sunday

Did #DarkKnightRises get a spot? Or #Brave? Or #TheLorax? I'm confused #SuperBowl

This is the lowest scoring #Superbowl  I have ever seen TF

Timeout AND a false start????  The #Bears must be proud #SuperBowl

LMAO. Did that #Giants player just get injured on the SIDELINE??? LOL #SuperBowl

Ballard is annoying. If the injury is that bad stop trying to run on it. #superbowl #superbowl46

Ballard attempted to test that knee on sideline? FAIL #superbowl

Thats a pass interference. Where's the flag? #SuperBowl

When it's a close game, it's a good game I think #SuperBowl

Love the seriousness the Americans get over #Superbowl. The managers are even funny going mad on the sidelines!

My TL is schizophrenic #SOSHoms #superbowl, similar words, entirely different meanings.

I love football. No I really just like them tight pants:) #Superbowl

For me the #SuperBowl is like TV in reverse where the commercial breaks are the program and the game is the commercial break

No one under the age of 25 will get that Ferris Bueller #SuperBowl commercial

Glad I can fwd thru most of the #SuperBowl #beer #commercials. I don't car how funny they r. They're still commercials.

damn my mom just won 300$guess thats the only good thing i have to say about the #superbowl

Right Patriots Lets fucking end this NOW #patriots #superbowl

Thank you #budlight for bringing attention to rescue dogs! #SuperBowl #brandbowl

Yo. refs is cheatin dog! Really???????  #SuperBowl

Yikes. That ref is probably calling his last NFL game, yeah? #PI #superbowl

hola I FINALLY got shown a working #superbowl stream at  Let's get crunk! RT this please!

#SuperBowl Sunday is the only Sunday out the year I drink.

Bad move by Giants burning 2 timeouts #superbowl

Get off your flag ref! #SuperBowl

They must have for SEC officials for this game #SuperBowl

Grrrrr! The Giants just burned two timeouts just to punt?! #SuperBowl

huge non-call by officials for potential pass interference on 3rd down. NYG doesn't convert. Pays will get ball back up 2 #SuperBowl

Can barley keep my eyes open now! But i'm gonna ride it out until the end! #SuperBowl

How many times can the NYG punt from the Pats 40yrd line? #superbowl

Me- bethany, u know the tvs that way yeah.. But the beautiful ladies are this way #superbowl

I'm excited to see the voice #SuperBowl needs to hurry up and go off!

Come on Eli Manning let's pull it together! There's less than 9 minutes left in the 4th. #SuperBowl

Winner ==  RT if you think #Madonna is rockin' it! #SuperBowl

The game is sooo fierce YO! damn! #Superbowl

I swear the commentators want the #Giants to win the #SuperBowl

Not sure whether that was more of a nice defensive series by the #Patriots or an awful offensive series by the #Giants #SuperBowl

Weird that we only hear a woman's voice when there's an injury at the #superbowl. Gender roles forever?

Madonna + Nicki Minaj + MIA + Cee Lo are in Indy. We're okay with this. Also  football. #IMSuperCity #SuperBowl

Giants #85 falling over twice has been the most interesting part of the #superbowl sad but funny

Oh dear, Motley Crue plugs Kia cars. will be pissed. #superbowl #sbcommercials

Unimpressed overall by the commercials this year (there have been a couple good ones) #SuperBowl

Outside of #chrysler the commercials for #superbowl have been terrible

Leaving workbet the roads gonna be clear cuz of the #superbowl

so basically this sandman dust is hallucinogenic #superbowl

#superbowl Like me, Madonna was 8 and in the 3rd grade when Super Bowl I was played.

hola I finally got shown a working #superbowl live stream at  Get the beer out! RT this please!

Penalties sure set the Giants back. New England could stick the dagger right here. #SuperBowl #sb46

Doing well. How are you? I love football and the #SuperBowl is always a great event! GO PATS! :)

How long are we going to keep using Roman numerals for the Super Bowl? #superbowl

no, I'm home alone working on a research papah. not watching either.  I don't wanna be held responsible for #SuperBowl #jinkx

Have announcers ever been against a team so bad? #superbowl

In a dilemma! Want the #SuperBowl to end so I can go to bed but I also want it to continue because i'm enjoying it! #GoPatriots

That's two pass interference calls missed #superbowl

gronkowski and hernandez look like a bunch of guidos #patriots #superbowl

Pats up 2-0 on bad refereeing. 1st half holding call, now no PI? #superbowl

you didn't go to some #SuperBowl party? This is a Super Bowl I'm actually watching.

Should have been interference there on Moore. Huge non call by the refs. Had left arm draped ov shoulder. #superbowl #nfl #giants #patriots

Samsung Galaxy Note was by far the best Ad I have seen today #NFL #Superbowl #Superbowlads

#Giants prolong run with questionable call, #Patriots ennd it with another. All's fair I guess. #SuperBowl

Kia ad with lumber jacks, Adriana Lima, Irish countryside, horse, GIANT sandwich is FREAKING FUNNY#SuperBowl

Its not socially acceptable to walk in here with a case of beer. Why are we here? #SuperBowl

Why was everyone just posting about inception? Wasn't that movie popular last year? What about the #superbowl # ohwait

Pretty unimpressed/disgusted by the number of #superbowl ads with scantily dressed women in them. #notbuyingit

My mom sed the giants shuld grab the patriots by their dreadlocks hahaha! #superbowl

Career Builder falls flat to me.  #sbads  #brandbowl  #superbowl  been there, done that

Why Madonna Isn't Getting Paid For Her #SuperBowl Halftime Gig

Pizza. Wings. And a party on a Sunday? Yes please. #SuperBowl

Do homework or continue watching the Superbowl? #Superbowl wins every time.

Yeah right, Avg Joe is gonna pass up for the average chickOKAY #Superbowl

More people like football over jazz, but I swear to god the rules of jazz are WAY easier. #SuperBowl

Me too. RT My feed is now 1/3 #superbowl 1/3 #twitflix and 1/3 #DowntonAbbey

Monkeys in suits. Career builder wins the 'most american commercial' award. #superbowl

Monkey based Super Bowl adbest one yet #superbowl

I was at watching the commercials and pigging out! #SuperBowl

that Kia commercial had to be the best #SuperBowl commercial bull riding a rhino?? lumberjacks sawing a giant sub?? hysterical

I like the sandman commercial. Real guys liking real women.. Good for you Kia! #adbowl #brandbowl #SuperBowl

Where's Jon?? Anyone spot him yet? #Superbowl

#SuperBowl n the best hands w/ #NBC. Not overproduced + well done. Having Al Michaels helps. #Fox could learn a thing or 2. They won't.

Horrible call, giants got ripped #superbowl #raycharlesref

#SuperBowl #JSbowl Stephen Gostkowski, Patriots #3,  reppin the tigers at the super bowl!

This #Superbowl stadium sandwich platter has almost converted me into a football fan:

CareerBuilder refreshed monkey ad still gets a LOL. Nicely done. #Superbowl #getajob

gotta see you up there next year doing half time!! #SUPERBOWL

#superbowl that's a good point. Hmm Like a wall.

Do men really dream of big sandwiches? #superbowl

I haven't had nearly enough to drink for it to already be the fourth quarter. #Superbowl

I just read through, like a million tweets all about the #Superbowl, not one of them mentioned the actual score or w

hey I finally found a working #superbowl live stream at  Let's get drunk! RT this please!

The #herewego pup was so cute! And it gave a shout out to rescue dogs! #SuperBowl

i'd bite my nails if they weren't so pristinely manicured. #superbowl #chickwatching

The #SuperBowl has the highest sex trafficking rate of any event in our country.  Remember the victims and their traffickers tonight.

Follow Me iFollowBack #TeamFollowBack follow for a #InstantFollowBack #AutoFollowBack Its #SuperBowl follow me

is my main reason for liking the patriots. #bandwagonswag #wewt #SuperBowl

Everyone grumbling about the refs missing that call: #SuperBowl Refs are the best in the business. One call doesn't make or break a game.

Two of your favorite timeouts, to avoid delay of game-saved a total of 10 yards during the #superbowl. #fail

Honda, you dashed my hopes and broke my heart. #Superbowl #Brandbowl  #IwantedaFerrisBuellerSequel

Hope everyone is enjoying the #SuperBowl! Don't forget to #recycle those #coke bottles and #salsa containers:) #green

I am disappointed that you engaged in a misogynistic ad. Very disappointed. #notbuyingit #superbowl #fem2

Heading home from Austin after a great #EcoCAR2 Winter Workshop! Watching the #SuperBowl in the airport. Who are you rooting for?

yo I finally found a working #superbowl live stream at  Go Giants! RT this please!

NBC3rd world problems actually aren't funny. Fuck your commercial. #superbowl

Wish i coulda watched the #superbowl just for the awesome new commercials.

Best thing about this #SuperBowl? The pigs in a blanket I'm snacking on right now

My Twitter news feed has gone VERY quiet! Seems like everyone was watching at the start, only a couple left now. #NYGiants #Superbowl

BTW, looks like Ballard may have torn meniscus in left knee, based on how he was hurt and his trying to work it out #SuperBowl

The Career Builder chimps still crack me up. #AnimalsInAds can't go wrong. #SuperBowl

Nice to see a #superbowl commercial with the message 'help rescue dogs.' kudos to

Trying to figure out whether people are tweeting more about the #superbowl or the #superbowlcommercials???

Defence needs to make big plays now #Superbowl

I haven't seen a game this exciting since Alberta curling officials permitted extra-scrubby brushes in 1957. #superbowl

Let's talk ponies! I think we all can agree that Fluttershy would be watching the Puppy Bowl and Kitty Halftime show. #Superbowl #Brony

My contribution to #superbowl - deep fried mars bars. I wore my stretchy pants

I still think Madonna's halftime show was better than last year's halftime show. #superbowl

can I get a RT before I go to bed! Giants come back ! #superbowl

That nine days without solid food is finally paying off for Adriana Lima. #SuperBowl #BrandBowl #VictoriasSecret

Ugh so much foood. I can't move. #FoodComa #Superbowl

Ad with monkeys? If your gonna spend millions to air an ad at least try to make it an original idea. #superbowl

And now the lame announcers are making excuses for the lame #NFL #superbowl refs

Giants are getting as many bad calls as vs. Capriari. #superbowl #fb

Did Brady just get it off to Woodhead? #superbowl #misheardcommentary

Shout out to them ghetto #SuperBowl parties that have 24oz Shasta soda bottles and $5 little ceaser's pizza on Deck lol

Is it wrong to wish Tom Brady receive a horrible injury during #SuperBowl?#rhetoricalquestion#yourethinkingittoo#dontjudge

Whats The Best Commercial From The #SuperBowl So Far??

madonna looks like an ugly goblin. sounds worse. #superbowl

Most women hate the #Superbowl the same way most men hate going #Tampon shopping with you

4th Quarter:  The part of the game where I want to hide, but can't look away. #superbowl #gopats

Keep your picks for #SuperBowl difference maker coming. You could win a copy of Madden 12. #FibreOP

Brady is almost as good in the pocket as I am on Superstar Mode on #Madden. #superbowl

Well done Madonna for once again remaining relavent for the next 10 years =) #Superbowl #fb

#SuperBowl  what a great game!!! Go Giants!!!

yeah love the #Superbowl it's going to be an interesting last 10 mins. I think the patriots will take it #gopats

Good rush. Can the Pats get another touchdown and just hold the Giants up for the win? #SuperBowl

YES! ROCK N ROLL everyone #halftime #SUPERBOWL commercial rocked #MotleyCrue

I USE THAT PLAY IN MADDEN LOL! #Superbowl

Just #SuperBowl and twitter have kept me up :P

Things are looking up again for #New #England. Come on, #Patriots!!! #NFL #football #superbowl

That Pepsi Ad will be the best #Superbowl Ad for sure ! cc

I loved the Michael Phelps subway  commercial. He eats 12,000 calories per day. Rescue dogs for Budlight was great too.#Superbowl

#SuperBowl I'm so glad GE wants credit for employing people but paid NO TAXES last year.  Yea thanks you scum bags.

Which of Tommy Lee's trick drum kits would you want to see on the field? #frombadtoworse #superbowl

Cost to buy 30-second #superbowl ad in 1967: $54,000 says Nielsen. This year: about $3.5 million.   #admeter #sbads #sb46

if the Pats win.. Danny Woodhead for SB MVP!!! #superbowl

Hey Al Michaelsshut the fuck up about the fumbles already #Patriots #SuperBowl

Guess I'll see what all the fuss is about!! #SuperBowl

You don't even have to watch the #SuperBowl bc at least one person on your TL is tweeting every 30 seconds about it

I wonder if the guy who controls that camera on the wire over the field knows the guy who played the little alien in MIB. #superbowl

This game may be decided with a last minute field goal, very Ace Ventura. Einhorn and Finkel, Finkel and Einhorn#superbowl

New Pepsi #SuperBowl commercial has Elton John.  Want to win tickets to see him in Charleston?

Here comes a Green-Ellis fumble #NBCjinx #SuperBowl

Damn are all the #Giants made of glass today? #SuperBowl

Giants be droppin like flys. Go cry somewhere else, this is the #superbowl

DYING to watch Madonna's halftime show!! Waiting for it to be uploaded! #SuperBowl

I wanna punch the tv!all the giants keep getting hurt wtf?!  #SuperBowl

Concept was good. Everything between getting in car and breaking into other dream cld hv been SO much better #superbowl

Damn! This is thee most injuries/almost injuries I've ever seen during a #SuperBowl.

Cmon!!! A few calls from the refs would be nice!!! That was pass interference FFS #superbowl

I think it's adorable they show us the faces of the helmeted players. #Superbowl #betternottoknow

Oh #NBC, we know how bad you're hurting. Your Thursday night commercial just makes you look desperate. #Superbowl #Smashgottasavethenetwork

don't understand the rules, but i'm enjoying watching it! #BBCSuperBowl #SuperBowl

I love that cushion graphic NBC used. #SuperBowl

I generally like Michaels and Collinsworth, but this has not been their finest performance. #SuperBowl

Patriots will push on now, and take the title. I'm off to bed. Chappers shouting too much for this time of night. #Superbowl #bbcsuperbowl

Giants medical staff is overworked and underpaid tonight #SuperBowl

QT I Ain't Worried Bout ShitThe #Giants Still Got This Yo!! #NFL #SuperBowl  Hell Yeaa !

carried the ball 600 times and never fumbled? Wow. #Superbowl

Retweet if you are recording the #SuperBowl so you can fast forward through the game & only watch the halftime show & commercials

Feel rather good for this time at night #superbowl

These football players are getting taken out like crazy. #SuperBowl

This morning's Chelsea vs. ManU game #SuperBowl

Thinking of going to the states next year to watch the #SuperBowl cause these commercials are #Atrocious

Every single play is crucial from tgis point on. #superbowl

Giants VS Jets. So far tonight, The Giants have scored 1 TD and Kim Kardashian has given Mark Sanchez VD #LateShowWriters #SuperBowl

What's so special about a phone with a pen.. #SuperBowl

Im trying hard to keep myself from falling asleep  #SuperBowl

Why is everyone getting hurt ? This is the #SUPERBOWL, getcha ass up and be a man about it #nomorecrybabies

I feel for you #Giants fans. You hate to see these injuries pile up for them.  #SuperBowl #SB46 #SBXLVI #Giants #Patriots #NFL

song montages are terrible ideas - yeah I'm looking at you #samsung.  #brandbowl #superbowl

Talk about a throwback commercial #Samsung. But who really wants to use a stylus? #BrandBowl #SuperBowl

Yes, I do believe in a thing called love! #thedarkness #superbowl

whats up hey there I finally found a real #superbowl stream over at  Go Patriots! RT this please!

That #SuperBowl  commercial translated: only D-Bags buy Samsung phones.

Some patient free thinker just jumped to the front of the line #superbowl #commercial

Holy shit! The guy from the Darkness is still alive #superbowl

Curious about the Samsung Note from their #superbowl ad? Our review:  #tech

English retro-rockers The Darkness get their Superbowl moment. Cool. #reactlabs, #superbowl

That song is the JAM! Haven't heard #TheDarkness in years! #Superbowl

The Darkness commercial is now my favorite #superbowl

Big drive here got the Pats. Long drive here could decide the game #SuperBowl

How do you screw up the #SuperBowl in Canada? Throw in a commercial for Treasure Buddies. Like the #PuppyBowl wasn't enough.

Too soon to say it feels like it's running away from the Giants a bit? #superbowl

I'm not interested in the #SuperBowl. To put it more bluntly, I don't give a fuck.

Nice buildup, Well done on carrying an ongoing campaign into the #Superbowl. #brandbowl

Is that NYG Defense getting tired? Sure thing. #superbowl

Was the Miranda Kerr in that commercial? I think it was! #SuperBowl

For this to be a #Superbowl game, the score sure doesn't look like it

Have to admit I only wanted to watch the #SUPERbowl for the commercials but all of them are boring af wtf happened?! #anotherSUPERbowlFAIL

hey I finally found a real #superbowl live stream at  Go Giants! RT this please!

Lmaoo t mobile commercial #SUPERBOWL I believe in a thing called loveeee

600 carries and never fumbled? Impressive. Not so sure about the name, though. #superbowl

My TV suddenly time traveled back a few years- just saw an ad for a phone with a stylist. #superbowl

Seriously? A pen with a smart phone? How many people will lose that in the first five minutes of purchase? #SuperBowl

Sooooooo after the #SuperBowl I'm expected to do a butt load of homework #procrastinatingproblems

Everything to do with the #SuperBowl is a trending topic. Cray.

People call #Oscars the #SuperBowl of award shows. I like 2 refer 2 #SuperBowl as Academy Award of sporting events. Better outfits

Adrianna Lima is trending in the Washington DC Area.. She was only in 1 commercial about fucking flowers What am I missing??? #superbowl

Did the Koreans just discover the palm pilot ?! #tcot #news #SuperBowl

knew when they mentioned there weren't any fumbles yetthere would be one soon!!  #superbowl

What was worse than the halftime show? That nonsensical Samsung ad. #Superbowl

Totally Stuffed. Now wants to make popcorn. oy vey #Superbowl

I can't wait to NOT watch The Voice tonight after the #Superbowl

*fist bump* Thank you so much! #superbowl

Matt Ayers just got launched out of a canon on a #SuperBowl Add!

John Stamos getting head butted winning the #SuperBowl commercials!!

RT: We want fifty on the screen #superbowl

I'm having as much fun watching this #SuperBowl as I did the #BCSChampionship.

got the gadget play dusted off from the closet of pain #sb46 #superbowl Pats on move

Doing HW and watching the #superbowl totally unsuccessful

Yeah, Samsung smartphones still blow. #SuperBowl

Go #GIANTS JUST DO IT FOR NEW YORK #SUPERBOWL !!

Hmm.  I wonder if #HereWeGo can handle a corkscrew and a wine glass? Maybe a blender?? #SuperBowl

Ya know if there is one thing I found out about toda.. its that I most certainly can not stand Bradshaw. #superbowl

Watch, Vote, & Share your favorite #SuperBowl #XLVI Commercials via Ad Blitz 2012 channel

Nice reverse!!! Nice block Tom!! #Superbowl #SB46

if #Superbowl so great y ent y'all watching it 'stead of scoping its tweets lmao #yawn !

I think the Patriots have the advantage right now with about 6:00 to play.  I'd take Brady over Manning in a tight game.  #superbowl

The #superbowl commercials are #stupid this year! If only I had the #herewegodog #toocute

Brady throwing a block, that's dedication #superbowl

So now that I've been the toilet and I'm not dead, I'm gonna try and sleep. #Superbowl you have been very entertaining. STAY AGGRESSIVE.

NFL Chinstraps are tiny underwear for your face #SuperBowl

If I needed a new phone, I'd buy that Samsung Galaxy solely because of that commercial #thedarkness #ibelieveinathingcalledlove #superbowl

Wow. Tommy Lee did not age well :-( #SuperBowl

Watching the game on my iPhone . Man I live this machine #skygo #superbowl

Hey #giants defense, how about a stop on this drive? #superbowl

samsung is marketing a cell phone WITH a stylus? r they gonna make a PDA next, or maybe a 2way pager? #galaxynote #superbowl

A close but relatively unexciting game, bizarre halftime show & commercials that would make more sense of I was on acid. #SuperBowl

LOVED the Darkness/I believe in a thing called love #SuperBowl commercial!!!!! Well done guys. My fave commercial so far!

Was that Mrs. Orlando Bloom / Miranda Kerr in the Samsung commercial?! #wtf #Superbowl #commercial

5am in doha, at #superbowl party, can't help but check twitter - disjointed mix of tweets on the game & #syria #egypt violence. Crazy world.

Go Giants. Go now, they are all drunk already #SuperBowl

First down by #TomBrady #superbowl KEEP EM COMING!

I'm hoping the Giants score soon. #superbowl

- SO GREAT TO HEAR YOUR SONG  !!! One of my fave #superbowl ads tonight!

Started with a 7 layer dip but we are down to our last layer with seven minutes to go. I should have made 7 more minutes of dip. #superbowl

#Cirocbowl commercials are NICE! Replace these lame #Superbowl commercials. Next year #cirocbowl commercials as the halftime show.

Can the #Superbowl PLEASE be done now so I can watch

I'm waiting for the annexation of Puerto Rico #superbowl

Each year, #GoDaddy #SuperBowl commercials convince me to stay away from their products and services.

Sound on BBC a lot better but picture on Sky Sports is excellent. #Superbowl

Some last minutes magic? I hope so! #superbowl

Just saw #justinHawkins rockin the pink spandex on the #superBowl commercial? #darkness in 2 weeks #HOB sunset Strip #SWAG

Why so many #victoriassecrets models in #superbowl commercials?!?!

Samsung + The Darkness + Brian Urlacher = WINNING #SuperBowl

This game is too close for comfort - ugh ! #Superbowl

4th quarter is kinda #stressful and my belly hurts #superbowl.  Really hoping to buy a new shirt this week.  #PATS

About to play some #TempleRun while finishing watching the #superbowl Bowl

That Galaxy ad would have worked if the flash mob reenacted a Chinese factory assembling iPhones #superbowl

Why am I watching the game alone #SuperBowl

Having presentations the day after the #SuperBowl should be illegal.

hahaha Tom Brady going for the block. #loveit #superbowl

Bitch ass Belichick is outcoaching old Ass Coughlin!!! #nfl #superbowl

This. This is a Super Bowl.Personally I enjoy soggy cereal but I can't fault the ingenuity.#SuperBowl

Okay, The Darkness, it was good to hear you again. #SuperBowl

5 minutes left on the clock.  Patriots on control of the ball #Superbowl

I could honestly care less about the Super Bowl. Our society focuses way too much on sports. Ridiculous! #SuperBowl #Idon'tcare

Enjoying #Superbowl treats?   w Mon1EST . Learn how NOT to feel guilty about eating!   //t.co/1ezkkNoT

I just wanna give a shout out to Lamar Hunt #RIP, former owner of the Chiefs, for coining the term #SuperBowl #kcchiefs

Five minutes left in the 4th quarter. NE 17 - NYG 15. Come on #Patriots #SuperBowl

The Samsung commercial was awful! Not engaging whatsoever. #SuperBowl

Hernandez quick out the backfield + the rub is damn near unguardable #SuperBowl

And slowly but surely, I get the feeling that the #NYgiants gate is slowly being closed. And perhaps locked shut. Spewing. #superbowl

All of Europe is pretending to understand #superbowl. I trust Americans will make the same effort in a few hours for t

#Superbowl All eyes on Superbowl. deep in 4th quarter and only 2 points in it.

What I'm having for dinner. It's no #sexualchocolate but very refreshing. #superbowl

My nerves are bad right now #superbowl

I don't really know football but whoever you guys are you're doing pretty good against the giants #SUPERBOWL #clueless-nick-

Someone in the commentator booth doesn't have their phone on silent. I keep hearing the glass chime text alert going off #superbowl

WOW.  Wes Welker drops what would have been a TD pass.   #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Dang! He just couldn't pull it in. SMH!!

Somebody help that ma! He's choking! #SUPERBOWL

DATS RIGHT DROP DAT SHIT BITCH #SuperBowl

I'm gunna explode from all the#superbowl food

Getting down to the wire in this game.  Whose it gonna be?  #SuperBowl

is a crazy baller, loves the #superbowl and the #SuperBestFriends  the guy is pretty much a god Like #EliManning

Wes Welker's mustache looks like it shouldn't be allowed near a playground. #superbowl

For a corpse, I thought Michael Jackson did a great job at #halftime. #superbowl

Gotta love the slow motion  patriot face smack replay. Lmao #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl with my fam. Dads yelling at the tv, kids are on there phones and moms are on the computer.

What a big Drop right there WOW!!! #Superbowl

I'm not at the #superbowl but saw this pic that was quite topical #foundtwenties

I believe in thing called looooove! #SuperBowl

So there's 1 more game to go. Who do you think will win the #SuperBowl today? Will you notice all the work the #gardene

I nearly just dropped my iPhone in the #SuperBowl. (Ya, know the toilet. But I got fast hands.) #supercatch #receiver

Ok. So, #SuperBowl XLVI is ten(X) minus fifty(L) plus 6(VI).  I thought it was Larger (XL) than last year by 6(VI) times.

Impressed by the Pats bench's synchronized face palm. #SuperBowl

4 mins left!Bring it home Brady! Let's end this once and for all #superbowl #patriotsftw

Wes welker should have caught that!! #superbowl

Well the Giants are getting the ball back, and this game immediately has a feel of Super Bowl 42.. #SuperBowl #Giants #Patriots #Rematch

ugh almost was my quater but i aint trippin..there always next time #SuperBowl

This is about to get interesting. do we have another perfect set-up for a #giants comeback?   Probably.  #superbowl

Super Bowl would be better if they had a few more adds #superbowl

Tom Brady has looked completely average this half. And I am loving it. #SuperBowl

You have got to be kidding me! #Superbowl  come on let's get it together!

Here we go then, now or never. #Giants #Superbowl #nailbiting

Manning needs to work some magic! #superbowl

You chasing players on a bike down the fieldpriceless! LOL. Can't wait to watch this! #superbowl

M.I.A. really gave the cameraman the middle finger during the #SuperBowl halftime show. LMFAOOO!!

How's your nerves holding up then people?! #superbowl

SHIT! Tight game ,please NOT AGAIN #Superbowl

4 minutes left! Stay ahead Patriots! #Superbowl

.for the record. I don't like this and I am not comfortable this situation. #SUPERBOWL

#Hoboken #NYGiants #Superbowl Big Stop by NY Giants. Now it is Eli Manning time!

The defense that gave up a lot needs to come up with a Superbowl stop. #Patriots #SB46

Big stop by the #Giants. Game on the line here. #SuperBowl

hey I finally found a working #superbowl live stream over at  Go Giants! RT this please!

This game is getting tense. The #Superbowl always does! #GoPatsGo #DEFENSE

It comes down to the final drive.  Go Giants. #SuperBowl

i really dont know whats going on in this #superbowl far tomany breaks in play,wouldrather watch blind men play golf

changed my mind - tense stuff #Superbowl

Dont like this.have a feeling we``ll loose this one:s #Patriots #Superbowl

Ohhh god Coming down to the wire #superbowl

It's 2:33am in Accra, Ghana and I'm up watching #sb46. Go Patriots! #superbowl #233moments

Conspiracy no. 2: no flags for hits on defenseless receivers. The #nfl can get away with that in the regular season, but not the #superbowl

In US #SuperBowl more important at the moment wait a sec k?

Two feet down, he's inbounds. Another circus catch for Manning in the #SuperBowl

I wish the Packers were in the #superbowl so I could stare at Clay Matthews. But thats the only reason. haha

Can't be too happy about that. C'mon, #Patriots, pick up the pace. #SuperBowl

Tight game.  If the Giants want it enough, they could take it.  #SuperBowl

I think he caught it but we shall see massive decision to be made here! #Superbowl

I'm betting Samsung is the most panned #superbowl ad on Twitter. If only for the sheer # of geeks who don't want the st

#superbowl GIANTS awesome catch both feet were in woo whoo

Let's touch & agree for a Giants touchdown. In jesus name, amen. #Superbowl

#snf acts like its the 1st time I have ever seen football #superbowl

Glass #superbowl is typical of the luxury tableware used by wealthy Romans  #score!

Eli, dear God. Helluva throw. #Giants #SuperBowl

CMON DEFENSE!! LETS STOP THE FUCKING GIANTS!    #SuperBowl

This game is so close! Good luck teams! #superbowl

Last few mins now.. If u changed the channel.. This is where it gets excited.. #foryoufootballrookies #Superbowl

s/o to the girl who came to the superbowl party with a bowling ball and a superman cape on.. #Superbowl

#superbowl the first big play of the Game and Bill Belichick had a perfect view of it.

Less than 4 min to go. Anything can happen! #SuperBowl

His feet were both in bounds and on the ground! Have to give it to himgood catch! #superbowl

And the ref is called for excessive celebration after his call is confirmed.  #SuperBowl

I want this Super Bowl so badly! Go Pats. #XLVI #superbowl #Patriots #PatsNation #Giants

you just basically said that Friday night football games are better than the #superbowl.. U hear that

Vince Neil needs his heart kick started literally. #superbowl

& I r practicing r cheerleading routine 4 r personal halftime. Go Madonna #SuperBowl

Game changing throw! Giants can win this! #Superbowl

Can you imagine if the #Patriots win again on a missed FG? #SuperBowl

Brilliant  my response to the Fiat #superbowl ad  #NotBuyingIt #streetharassment

#Madonna 's #SuperBowl Halftime Performance: Hit or Miss?

Aghhhhh! SO NUTS! Here we go Giants! #superbowl #nyg

I think sporting events (like the #SuperBowl) are the greatest benefactors of HD & HQ video technology. #JustAmazing

I think I'm the only person in my house rooting for the #Pats. #SuperBowl

Eli Manninggggg what is going to happennnn #SuperBowl

Or is Peyton Viper and Eli Eel? With that last throw I think Elis Ultron  #PATRIOTS #Superbowl #GIANTS

Not looking good for the #Patriots, giants have an opportunity to win this. #patriots need to step it up! #superbowl

It's deja-vu all over again. #superbowl #iloveit

Haters gunna hate, football players gunna play #Superbowl

Common giants! About 3 minutes left! You got this. Touchdown!! #SUPERBOWL

Its cute how excited guys get over football #superbowl

#Superbowl go giants! Manning you beaut

Now that looked like Eli didn't want it that time, lol. #superbowl

Tyree looking snazy on the sidelines#Superbowl Legend! #GoGiants

No doubt about it , both feet were in. #superbowl

Hahaha It's fun to pretend to care about football one day out of the year. #SuperBowl

haha you caught that too? Al tried to cover for him (that must be 101). #SuperBowl is getting good!

Actually more excited for #thevoice than the rest of this #superbowl. Hurry up Eli!

Eli with a gorgeous pass along the sideline. Great catch, but Manningham can't The nice catch without a perfect throw. #SuperBowl

Don't know which is more awesome, that catch or David Tyree's tie #SuperBowl

Yeesh, my guts are in enough of a turmoil! This game is tying it up on KNOTS! #superbowl

Some of the #Superbowl commercials weren't funny like last year..

WHERE WERE YOU THROWING?! ELI, YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND IS NOT REALLY ON THE FIELD WITH YOU. THERE, THAT'S A GOOD THROW. GOOD. #Superbowl

Looks like this is going to be the same as their last #Superbowl meeting! Another miracle catch by the Giants.

This is a very close and low scoring game. #SuperBowl

Unbelievable play from Eli/Manningham. #SuperBowl

The butterflies in my stomach are out of control. Cmon #Giants #superbowl

This is possibly one of greatest games I've ever watched #superbowl

Wait, there are announcers? I wasn't paying attention to the babbling. #superbowl

No NFL team has ever won a #SuperBowl in 4 different decades.  The #Giants can do that tonight with a win in 4 consecutive decades. #sb46

I tweetsploded the #Superbowl. Follow if you're a fellow twitter-bug!

#SuperBowl:  Manningham!!! He is a wolverine!  Go Blue!

#SuperBowl What an intense game! its getting close, Come On #Patriots!!

Inside 35, field goal range w/ 3min left #superbowl

This game better. Not come down to a missed FG.  #SuperBowl

They just better not score too fast #Giants #SuperBowl

Okay Collinsworth just compared Manningham's catch to David Tyree's catch.time to mute his Mic during extended reviews.#Superbowl

Although he will have to eat up some time to make sure the #Patriots don't have much time left on the clock.#NFL #superbowl

And we finally have a ball game! #superbowl

I wish #superbowl was just bare people rolling down an isle like bowling balls and the 'Giants' are chasing after them. #ImWatchingNewGirl .

I call it play!! Now do  you see why!!! These bitches calling me #manningeli #superbowl

Keep running why you keep stoppin ughhhh #SUPERBOWL

Holy hell this game is nerve racking! #SuperBowl

possibly one of the best #superbowl catches ever #clutch

However this ends, Giants & Pats provide quality entertainment, as expected! Great #superbowl

#superbowl Smug ad critiques are rampant and annoying. They are just ads people.

This close of a game is very stressful, even though I technically have no idea what's been going on the entire time. #superbowl

When Eli misses a pass he start looking like sumthn stank #Superbowl

I'm sure Scott Norwood appreciates that his name hasn't been forgotten. Oh wait. #SuperBowl

This is a close game but something is missing from it #SuperBowl

Wondering what Toni Basil thinks of Madonna looting her intellectual property. #SuperBowl #HalfTime

At least this game hasn't been a blow-out. #Superbowl

Even though she's passed out, Sprocket is still routing for the #Giants. #Superbowl

Yep, a presser by as competition to #SuperBowl . Her new Press Sec is a genious.

Wouldn't have guessed Welker would have the drop that could cause the Pats the  #SuperBowl  #SB46

Need to kill more clock. CAN'T give Brady time. #nfl #giants #superbowl

I gotta take a shit but im holding it until the 2 minute warning  #SuperBowl

#superbowl #halftime #madonna did the menopausal shuffle! Moves like jagger

RT if you think #Madonna is rockin' it! #SuperBowl -- classic ha!

Mitt Romney wished the SF Giants good luck in the #SuperBowl LOL

I'm not one for sports but this is a wild 4th quarter #GOPATS! #Superbowl

#SuperBowl and eating a catalan sandwich ah the life !

All these Americans going to parties for the #SUPERBOWL and I'm just staying up into the middle of the night in Northern Ireland to watch!:)

Josh has been on fire w his commentree  #Superbowl #gottolovehim

I think that the patriots are about to lose #SuperBowl

Is there anyone in the world who likes Chris Collinsworth? #superbowl

Sometimes I pretend that I like football and watch the #SuperBowl. This year, not so much.

two minutes! COME ONNN GIANTS #superbowl

Eli is bringing it here. Let's have a touchdown pass then. #superbowl

and I are killing these #Superbowl tweets. I'm glad I'm not th only one who cares but not enough to understand. XD

I am about to have a stroke! #superbowl

Biggest play so far was drop by Wes Welker. #SuperBowl

Chugging beers to make my night much better lets go patriots #superbowl

my heart is racing and i never watch this ! #SuperBowl

watching #SuperBowl is making me want next year to come faster so flag football can start up again at school!

You can't leave Tom Brady and the #Patriots any time But I'm sure the #Giants know that. #SuperBowl

I really am tired of it though #Superbowl

Alright Giants, run the time down and get a field goal, them hold the Pats back! #GameWinningPlay #superbowl

Wow!!! What a great climax to game! Can eli keep holding his nerve to get the TD? #MVP #superbowl

If Eli beats Brady twice there's no doubt he's #ELIte #SuperBowl

If Manningham drops a pass, he'll be the Easter Manning Ham. #SuperBowl

I'm daring to watch the last few minutes of the #superbowl with my Patriot loving husband.

Is Tyree not playing because he is being penalized for wearing such ugly ties?  #SuperBowl

2 minutes left on the 18 yard line, surely not for the Giants? #superbowl

Eli out there carving up the Patriots looking like Peyton. #SuperBowl

Bloody glad I stayed up! #superbowl

I could honestly just want this game to never end. #superbowl. #ilovesports

11 of us here, 10 of whom are going for the #Giants. Every single one of us nervous. #SuperBowl

Did you guys just see that amazing catch?! He caught it up against his helmet! #samegame #SuperBowl

Who's in charge of these commercials? Khloe and Lamar season 2 promo should of been one #justsayin #superbowl

I believe in Eli! You can do it!!! #SuperBowl

#4thquarter #elitime #superbowl let's go giants, bring it home!!!

Watching other teams play football feels like I'm cheating on the #Saints. #SuperBowl #WhoDat

I'm not much into NFL, but I'm getting more and more into this as the game's going on, bizarre halftime shows and all. #superbowl

If NYG's blow it now, they never deserved it! #NFL #superbowl

This isn't healthy. My heart stops every 5 seconds. omg. #superbowl

If I'm Patriots, start burning timeouts to preserve as much time as possible for Brady. This means Giants need 1 more first down. #superbowl

I don't think this is boding well for the Pats #superbowl

Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. #SuperBowl #Giants

Man I hope the Giants can finish this off! #superbowl

Grrr im not near a tv _ someone update me on the score please?? #SuperBowl

#superbowl the game is too exciting.  Downton abbey will be later.

Only 2-Minutes left of the best #superbowl ever! 15-17

this is a really good game even though I'm not rooting for anyone really :) but the halftime show was freakin awesome #SuperBowl

LOL! so true, they clearly planned it to be that way. :(  #SuperBowl

See all the #SuperBowl commercials right after the game on Twitter (powered by at adscrimmage.twitter.com #ustream

GoDaddy taking objectifying women to a whole new level. #superbowl

Nice..they leave my Mom and I with no food cause we are too busy watching the #superbowl C'mon #Giants !

Is that the Game Changer for the Giants. Sure was. Now definitely Tom Brady will be tested. It's All down to him. #SuperBowl

And they would use Gaga's song after Madonna performs can you say Gayest #superbowl in history Yayy

Some of you females need to go watch the #PuppyBowlthe #SuperBowl is for men.

Why are these Go Daddy ads so ridiculous, year after year?? #superbowl

2 minute warning come on ELI and giants!!! #Giants #superbowl

Spoiler alert.   Tynes kicks FG as time expires.  Boring. #SuperBowl

such a good game. 2 minutes to go giants in the redzone #letsgogiants #superbowl

Ughhhh i am goin crazy over this game #Superbowl

Whats going on?!?!?!?! #Superbowl fail #patriots so sad.

I think I like the other Swamp People promo better - the one with the strange smiles #superbowl #brandbowl

#BBCSuperBowl is trending more than #SuperBowl. Brits rule, right? RIGHT!?

Ok Giants lets beat those Patriots tonite #superbowl

#Sheprobablyahoodrat if she thinks Aaron Hernandez is fine and shit. #SuperBowl

#SUPERBOWL We make a touchdwn, we won da Game.. #teamGiants

It would be interesting to know if paid for logo placement #brandbowl #SuperBowl

Two minutes of regulation left in #SuperBowl XLVI. Click for the play by play broadcast schedule:

Clock Management is key now, something most NFL coaches stink at.  May decide this game.  #Superbowl

I figured this game would start getting interesting in the last two minutes! #herewego #superbowl

ya buddy it's gonna be a helava #superbowl  finish

And by scoring I mean hit the touchdown. Gostkowski is NOT going to miss a FG response if Tynes merely kicks the FG! #superbowl

Dear History channel, not only was that commercial annoying but you're supposed to be about HISTORY. #superbowl

quick! pause it so i can scan the QR code #really? #superbowl #brandbowl #godaddy #adworkers

Oh Danika. Does the world really need another godaddy ad? #strategyisold #superbowl

Protested commercialized, testosterone driven, frivolous, Neolithic  #GoDaddy,  #Superbowl  by making #quiche.

Really?  Godaddy heaven?  I don&#39;t think so!  #superbowl

This is going to be a very interesting final 2 min. Love these close #Superbowl we have been having the last few years.

I swear i'll quit tweetin' bout the #SuperBowl as soon as this shit ends

8 yards from the goal line! #Superbowl First down!!!

Does Danika Patrick race cars anymore or is she just a godaddy hoochie now? #superbowl

That's rough to tear your ACL in the #SuperBowl but not as rough as your tactless team releasing you the day before.
