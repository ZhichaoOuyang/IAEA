Breaking news, The Greeks have asked the euro zone for players to bail them out of the #euro2012  has apparently said no

Samaras and Baros both vying for that 'shittest striker at Euro 2012' award. Dreadful. #itv #euro2012

McDonald's provided all the player escorts. I might try a 'Player Escort burger after the Euro's! #Euro2012

My lowdown on the #Euro2012 scene in #Egypt  Euro 2012: The View From Egypt  cc:

The last time a team failed to win a Euros match after leading 2-0 at half-time was by Czech Republic #Euro2012

Racial political issues have taken centre stage at the euros. #Euro2012  who would want to take there kids to watch a game and feel safe?

GOAL Greece (Gekas,53) Greece 1-2 Czech Republic. Watch a free HD stream of the Euro 2012 match.  #stveuros #euro2012

Petr Cech and the Euros REALLY don't go well together do they? #Euro2012

Yes Cech what a keeper!! He loves playing in the euro's lol #Euro2012

Your going down with the euro! Down with the euuuuuuro! #greece #Euro2012

Oh Goalll For Greece Might Kick Start It off Now  #Euro2012 #Euros

I knew would score at the euros! #EURO2012 #Gekas

Wonder what prat-ini and blatter would b saying if the trouble in Warsaw 2nt had been in the uk? Lifetime ban from euro comps? #euro2012

Seen some poor goal keeping this euros and from top keepers too #Euro2012

Even though he's in my EURO dream team I've always said it, Petr Cech is MASSIVELY overrated! #euro2012

No one has been luckier this Euro than Greece.  #greekleafclover #Euro2012

Calamity Cech strikes again, like in every Euro!Ooops! #Euro2012

Greece are the worst team in the Euros, don't think I've seen a worse player than Samaras! #Euro2012

Russian Polish fans clash before emotionally charged Euro 2012 match  #Euro2012

That was the easiest goal in the Euro so far #Euro2012

I have to wonder is Petr Cech is having Euro flashbacks from Turkey 4 years ago. #Euro2012 #CechHowler

Cech, Sczezsny and Given. All Prem keepers, all culpable for goals at Euro's #Euro2012

The refs in euro 2012 have been awful. Ruining the balance of play in most games #Euro2012

The refs at the euros are so shite hardly make the right decision #inconsistent #Euro2012

I like it when the camera man perves on the hot chicks at the Euros #Euro2012

Joe hart's Fifa setup at the Euro #Euro2012

Best part of the Euros so far is seeing all these babes in the crowd! #Euro2012

Many people blame the defender there, but Cech just dropped it; 100% on him. Not the 1st time he spilled a cross in the Euro. #EURO2012 #CZE

let the Greek players to replace the Greek politicians.. Definitely a euro-team #Euro2012

Bit late but Cech is having a howler in the euro's so far chronic keeping #Euro2012

Only two matches in Euro tournament did a team lose after leading 2-0. Both times it was the Czech Republic. Not looking good  #Euro2012

I will watch the euro 2012 but I'm more of a rugby man lol #Euro2012

Only 2 teams in history of Euros have not won a game after being 2-0 up. #CZE 96 and #CZE 08. Surely not #euro2012

This match is sooo poor, by far the worst match of the Euros at the moment, just two poor teams playing shite football #euro2012

stream the Euro game or pay attention in english class? definitely stream the Euro game. #Euro2012

Am I the only one who wonders HOW THE FUCK did Chelsea win the champions league with cech in goal. He is wank in euros #Euro2012

Is it just me or do anybody else think the the ball in the euro looks big than any other ball #Euro2012 #EuroShout #tango12

Samaras is so shit. He should be playing Sunday league football. Not in the euros! #Euro2012

Goal-ID | Antonio Cassano: Jual Thiago Silva = Tindak Kriminal!  | #euro2012

If these Greeks had a euro for every offside they wouldn't be in debt! #Euro2012 #Greece #banter

From the way Greece are playing I would suggest they smuggled their way in these euro's also #Euro2012

Does samaras playing in the euros make you think you could still turn pro? #dickipedia #euro2012

Uefa euro the polish team plays rough watch out russia #Euro2012

Dzagoev puts Russia up 1-0 over Poland. 65.7% of Euro 2012 Pickem  picks have Russia winning in Poland. #Euro2012 #Euros

How many headers had been scored in this euro ? A lot  #euro2012 #justAthought

I think Poland have deserved to score, but that was a good goal. Honestly wouldn't surprise me if Russia go on to win the Euros #Euro2012

Dzageov is the Euro top scorer with 3 goals ! #Euro2012 #DzagoevShow

Dzagoev will be this years random young guy transferred to a top league solely because of the euros #Euro2012

These euro games are full of kovs and itchs. #euro2012

This Euro Cup seems to have a lot of headers #Euro2012

POINTLESS STAT : I have seen nine of the sixteen teams at Euro 2012 play live #euro2012

if Germany get to the Euro final it will be the longest theyve been in Poland since 1945 #fact #Euro2012

Russia are looking the real deal in these Euros like! #Euro2012

I am actually scared what will happen in the Euro's if Poland lose tonight.. #Euro2012

There have been some very odd refereeing decisions during this Euro! #euro2012

Have to say, the referees and officials have been terrible so far in the Euros. #Euro2012

The refs at the euros are a fucking joke!! Scared to give fouls in dangerous areas and pens! #Euro2012 #hatethat

Czechs win violence breaks out at Euro 2012  #Euro2012

Russiathe dark horse of Europe and the Euro Cup. Playing some great ball #euro2012

I think the referees are bribed before they ref a game in the euros, or they have never refereed a game before. #Euro2012.

Alan Dzagoev getting my vote for euros top goal scorer, he looks a real talent! #euro2012.

I think #RUS might be a favorite to win the Euro this year, I'm surprised how deft they are on the field. #Euro2012

Good thing about Euro 2012 is that we haven't seen a 0-0 draw yet! Keep up the great football :D #Euro2012

Ray seems very generous so far through the Euros - 12/1 on Dzagoev to score next! #Euro2012

Russia 1-0 Poland, Arshavin involved playing out of his skin at Euro 2012 so far #Euro2012

In Soviet Russia, Russians win Euro #Euro2012

Will the real Andrei Arshavin please stand up? Been a total different player in the Euro's!!#Euro2012

The refs at Euro 2012 have been poor! #Euro2012

For folks watching Euro 2012, how did you become a fan of the country you are cheering for? Interested to hear the responses. #euro2012

Let's go, Germany  #EURO2012 (watching UEFA EURO 2012, Netherlands vs. Germany  S2012E12)

I really hope van persie plays like shit this euro so clubs don't want to buy him.. Haha #Euro2012

Watching euros in pub filled with POR fans is more uncomfortable than watching movie with graphic sex scenes with your grandpts #EURO2012

Van Persie messing me up. He's my Euro fantasy league captain. Pls atone for all your misses son! #Euro2012 #SSFootball

Who are you cheering for to win Euro Cup 2012? #Euro2012

Germany will win Euro's  Gomez will be top scorer #Euro2012 #fact

You know that this euro's tournament is a bit messed up when bendtner is challenging for the golden boot #thecrouchofdenmark #euro2012

Rvp's 'poor' (still early days!!) euros performance might show him just how well set up things are for him at arsenal #afc #euro2012

Rvp, Ronaldo, ribery big players with big reps not turned up at euros yet! #euro2012

Denmark made a great comeback but couldn't get the win. Now for the Germany game. These Euro games have been amazing #EURO2012

The Euros should be shown on Sky, then we wouldn't have to put up with the awful attempts at commentating from BBC and ITV #Euro2012

Netherlands (37)  Germany (34) were the top two goal scoring nations in qualification for Euro 2012. #backofthenet #euro2012

Both CR7 and Van Persie have been the biggest failure of Euro 12 after a hyper season with resp. clubs #euro2012. Country vs Club football!

So far, the players that have been brilliant for their clubs all season have been poor these euros. #Ronaldo #VanPersie #Euro2012

you were right about babes at the euros #Euro2012

Postiga joins EURO hat-trick club  #Euro2012

Fantastic game between portugal and denmark! Now germany and netherlands!! These euros pretty damn good so far! #Euro2012

still have faith in you, you're captain of my fantasy euro team. #Euro2012 #CR7

is it me or is mark lawrenson sounding suicidal tonight? all expense paid trip to the euros not cheering you up lawro? #euro2012

Mark Lawrenson has got one whiny voice , cheer up its not like your getting paid to watch the euros you Welsh jobber#bbcfootball #EURO2012

My eyes are sore from watchin too much euro action #euro2012

#Gomez sticks one in the onion bag to make it #Germany 1-0 #Holland #BBCfootball #Euro2012 #Euros #GER #NED

Hup Holland Hup #euro2012 (watching UEFA EURO 2012, Netherlands vs. Germany  S2012E12)

Will #Holland find themselves out of the tournament by the end of the evening?#BBCfootball #Euro2012 #Euros #NED

Brilliant first touch from Gomez there and a tidy finish #euro2012.  Euro 2012 Live Match Centre:

Germany took the lead against Holland in the Euro 2004 group game through Torsten Frings. #Euro2012

Could Holland be on their way out of Euro 2012 ? I remember Harry Redknapp suggesting it on Saturday. #Euro2012

Netherlands do shit in the Euros all the class players like Van Persie and Robben play shit #Euro2012

great skill  movement by gomez for that goal but i think if dutch want to stay in euro they need to be at least drawing by HT #euro2012

I want Europe's economy to get back on track. As i want Euro Cup to happen again.. #Euro2012

Starting to think i should have minimum defenders in euro team and more midfield/strikers.. clean sheets not looking likely. #Euro2012

Gomez !! I think germany will win that euro :(( #euro2012 SPAIN 3 !!

i love watching all the DJs get all riled up about the euro cup highly entertaining #euro2012

Germany will win the Euro's, i've said it since day 1 #Euro2012

BC-SOC--Euro 2012-Denmark-Portugal Lineups103rd Ld-Writethru SOC  #Euro2012

The Dutch need Biff in defence. George McFly has his scoring boots on #euros #euro2012

I think the question is more why can't our England play like other Euro/World teams in general #Euro2012

Can't believe that holland is going out of tha euros so early #unexpected #euro2012

While goal for Germany. Who would've thought Holland would lose their 1st 2 games at Euros. Bookies might have cleaned up. #Euro2012

Germany two DMs as a basis for their attack. Holland two DMs because they are shite at the back. Euro poetry #Euro2012

Uefa Euro is like a mini world cup with noticeable absences of Brazil,Chile,Paraguay,Argentina,Ghana,Nigeria Cameroon n Asians #Euro2012

How am I supposed to get any work done when the Euro Cup's on? Holland vs Germany! 1-0 Germany! #EURO2012

And a win for the Portuguese!! Euro 2O12 baby, Netherlands where you at?! #euro2012

Germany looking good in these euros,  got to be amongst the favourites #euro2012

Pretty sure I just saw a big euro nipple of a stadium. #euro2012

Germany is threatening to take over here. The Dutch have 60ish minutes to save their Euros. #Euro2012

Denmark 2 vs Portugal 3!! By far Euro 2012 best!!! Saxxxxxy! game!!! :D  and yea CR7 you can keep having your beauty sleep. lol #Euro2012

Euros could be won by any team. All the favourites are shit! #euro2012

I have a feeling that Germany are going to win the Euro's with Mario Gomez as tournament top goal scorer #EURO2012

So far only Arsenal benefit from RVP's Euro performance!No club will want him after his unbelievable wastefulness in front of goal #Euro2012

Euros definitely come before revision!! Haven't missed a game yet!! #commitment #Euro2012

Van Persie is having a shocker at the euros, why? #euro2012

Holland should bring on VDV and Kuyt if they want to stay alive in the Euros. If they lose they will be the first team to go out. #EURO2012

Life without Ruud van Nistelrooy  Van Der Sar #notsogood. #euro2012 Euro exit beckons for the Oranje

if the euros weren't on I probably would of revised more for exams, but football is always first #Euro2012 #ilovefootball

First Bendtner now Gomez this is turning into the Euros for the strikers that nobody thinks can play. #Euro2012

Another brill finish by Gomez. The Dutch tipped by many look miles off pace although Germans look good bet to win euros #Euro2012

Netherlands 0-2 Germany, Gomez has scored two quality goals for Germany and looks like Netherlands are going out of the Euro's #Euro2012

GOMEZ AGAIN!!! Another screamer!! Netherlands out of the Euro 2012 perhaps? 39' NED 0-2 GER #EURO2012

Germany will now win the Euros, 2 world class finishes!! #Euro2012

euro 2012: 40th minute- Holland 0-2 Germany #euro2012

Germany to win the Euro's and Mario Gomez to be top goalscorer at the start of the tournament was 14/1. Not bad odds at all! #Euro2012

Hollandd haventt turnedd up too the euros this year!:( #Euro2012

CONSPIRACY!! RVP incredible in the league=Dogshit in the euros, Gomez, cows arse and Banjos in CL Final=Goalscoring machine #euro2012

2-0 Gomez again! Does anyone still think its Holland's Euros? #Euro2012

My team in the Euro 2012 = Germany! Since my last name is German, and I'm a little bit German, let's go Germany!!! 1-0

Talk about good timing by the producer with the euro image *v for victory* #Euro2012

Who would've thought that Netherlands would be the first team to go home in Euro 2012? #robbenispathetic #euro2012

Why did i put on holland to win the euros total pish !  #euro2012

Can't believe I'm missing the euros for rehearsals.. #gutted #euro2012

I'm feeling confident about my 'Germany to win the euros with Gomez top scorer' bet aswell :) #euro2012 #bettingtekkers

I should of bet told every man germany winnin euros even if they play spain #euro2012

Best half of the euros so far without doubt #euro2012

What a goal by mario Gomez, best finish of the euros for me. What a goal scorer! #Euro2012

The Netherlands left back is the youngest ever in the Euros. 18. How can the manager play him at such a difficult game? #Euro2012

I love how when everyone else score at the Euro's they go wild, Mario Gomez scores a screamer and just turns around. #AnotherDay #Euro2012

Holland are so shit they dont deserve to be at euro 2012 #euro2012

Another futile Euro campaign for the Dutch. Serves them right for still selecting that thug van Bommel. #Euro2012

#euro2012 germany are doing to holland what england did to them in euro 96 ,they're steam rollering them tonight

Germany are class!! Gonna take something special to stop them marching to the euro title #Euro2012

Sooo disappointed in the Dutch ! They have such a good squad and some worldy players, but are playing crap so far in the euros !! #Euro2012

Is it me or has the standard of goalkeeping in Euro 2012 been pretty atrocious? #Euro2012

The Netherlands are such a disappointment in Euro this year, Germany is kicking their butts #EURO2012

Netherlands should report Germany for this rapeage they are receiving. #euro2012 #Euros

#Euro2012 #prediction Gomez will be the Euro top goal scorer

How holland were considered as 1 of the favourites for euro 2012 playing like this #confused #euro2012

Total football?? Total rubbish! - Germany were my tip for the euros. Looking good so far! #Euro2012

and the Euro 2012 MatchCentre page appears to have crashed #euro2012

Mark lawrenson as got to be the best commentator at the euros! He says what he wants! #funnyguy #euro2012 #bbcsport

lol at how much van persie sucks in the euros so far #euro2012

Not gonna miss Holland in the Euro's! Least the love they were getting pre-tournament can now stop! Shocking defence #Euro2012 #Holland

Feel sorry for him but Willems is having a terrible game. Youngest player ever to play in Euros - maybe to much too early?? #euro2012

only had 3 euro left in the pocket so I stuck it on 'em! #Euro2012

Okae.. Holland is playing now. When is Netherland Playing pls ? #Euro2012 #euros

Gomez is going to be leading scorer in euros! #Euro2012

By end of euros, RVP might be cheaper than MCFC had expected #euro2012

Jormans looking favourites to win the euros at the moment, maybe peaked too early #Euro2012

Who else starts with 'Diiirrrrty Red and White Baaaastards' every time a goal is scored at Euros? #euro2012 #swfc #sufc

Don't get itRVP is able to carry arsenal through the majority of the seasonget him in the Euros and he's f**king useless!!!! #Euro2012

Seems to me Germany will win the Euros. #EURO2012

we really should have been Germany on the Euros. They are absolute cannibals! They devour any team! #Euro2012

Expected A LOT better from the Dutch in the Euros. Looks like they won't make it out of the group stages. #Euro2012

George Mcfly, I mean Mario Gomez, couldn't find water if he fell out of a boat in Euro 2008. #Euro2012

The camera men at the euro's do a really good job of finding really really attractive women #Euro2012 #better

said from day one that gomez will be top scorer at the euros. Got a feeling he may be right!! #euro2012.

Does Robben wear a tight enough shirt? #Euros #euro2012

WOWW. Almost 3-0! 2-0 for Germany at half time. Loooong way to go for the Dutch to save their Euro tournament. #Euro2012

amazing first half! Saying Germany's taking the Euro cup home! #EURO2012

this is why ive tipped Germany to win the euros, #Euro2012

PM Poll Question- RUSSIA COULD BEDOCKED POINTS IN EURO 2016 BECAUSE OF FAN BEHAVIOUR THIS YEAR? FAIR OR NOT FAIR? #Euro2012

Germany, Italy or England to win the Euros.. #euro2012

----Nobody currently cares about the economy because the Euro's are on #Euro2012 ,#lightenup

Euro 2012: 'Bumgate' hits Sweden's preparations for England game: One Swedish paper published a video   #Euro2012

Happy my Germany for Euro glory prediction is on track #Euro2012

This is an example of why I'm tipping Germany to win the Euro's #Euro2012

Holland have been poor in the euros i expected more #euro2012

Wish the Euros' started after my exams. #distraction #Euro2012

My pre-Euro prediction looks increasingly awful. Holland offering so little, Germans fluent and clinical as expected #Euro2012

Holland have been dissapointing Germany are definitly going to win euros #Euro2012 #hatetoadmitit #stupidgermans

I take back anything I said before, Germany are gonna win the hell out of this Euro. #Euro2012

Best teams in Euro Cup 2012 football #Euro2012 #Football #Soccer

Pirlo's free kick ? possibly the best of the Euros? it is possible was a cracking one #Euro2012

Match of the Day writer recommends his team of Euro 2012 so far:  #euro2012

Classic free kick from Pirlo. First goal at Euro from dead ball situation since 2004 and it was completely worth it. #Euro2012 #Italia

Ballack on ESPN Euro show is actually just Matt Damon doing his best Arnold impersonation. #Euro2012

Caved and got TSN's live streaming Euro pass for the month.  #Euro2012 #football

#Euro2012 - Pirlo scored that to settle this score -Italian furious with Croatians at Euro 2012 over tablecloth theft

By this rate the Euro's will be known for the many flares that have gone off, and I feel there is more to come #Euro2012

Why are there so many empty seats at the Euro's? #Euro2012

They just had to announce to refrain from throwing firey objects over the pitch in the Euro Cup. #classy #keepitclassyPoland #Euro2012

Fernando Torres proving that the  magic that got him the goal against Germany at the Euros 4 years ago is still intact. #Euro2012
