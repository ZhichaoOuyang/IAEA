Just watched the Gordon Brown speech on the #indyref. Makes you think what might have been. Fantastic speech.

Best of luck to the campaigners in the #indyref I hope that we can see a free and independent Scotland after the vote tomorrow.

Yes that 4 year old kneeling at his mum's feet looks particularly thuggish #voteyes #indyref

Best result w'd be narrow victory for 'no' That way, we'll get pressure for balanced devolution across UK rather than mad scramble #indyref

An amazing opportunity tomorrow to rid Scotland of the 3 main Tory parties based at Westminster #indyref

Got this from FB so i had to share #VoteYesScotland #indyref

for someone who talked about self belief all your life, I have lost faith in you after your #indyref comments

Answering #yes or #no in a survey is easy, putting your cross in a box that may change your life is another #wideopen #indyref

Big improvement in #indyref debate in last 2 weeks. No matter result, all Scotland can be proud of campaign. Still #No for me though.

Remember, voters; hold your nerve at the polling stations. Go for that #yes #voteyes #indyref #Scotland2014 #HopeNotFear

Peterhead, Aberdeenshire had a YES rally tonight  #YES #indyref #voteyes

Updated approx. p-value of 5 #indyref polls coming in as close together as they have if they were independent: p=0.017.

#indyref #undecided. If Scotland was currently independent, do you think we would vote to be governed by another country? #pleasevoteyes

Fantastic #indyref speech by Gordon Brown today -  #LabourNo #NoThanks

So tomorrow's a bit of a big day, isn't it? How exciting. #indyref

Some of those 10 #indyref point were based on real media stories, the rest are fake, hard to say which is which though. #Scotland

New Labour co-founder Gordon Brown prefers Scotland to be run by Tories rather than by the people that live here, all hot air.#indyref

loved the one when he told us 'the days of boom and bust have gone' #indyref he is the definition of 'bust'

Thank you.  It's not just me then. #indyref

Really good point. #indyref has certainly engaged lots of young people with politics through social media #NFPsocialmedia

No matter the result, i think #indyref has been great for Scotland. I suspect only a yes vote will allow that to continue.

Whatever happens tomorrow it will be the start for true reform. Not just for Scotland for England too. More devolution! #indyref

I bet if Scotland support him on Gibraltar he'll change his mind. #indyref

I'm going to make my prediction for #indyref Yes to win with 55%

'We built the future togethertell the nationalists this is not their country'.  Rousing stuff from Gordon Brown #indyref

terrible biased reporting, referring to Yes campaigners at Holyrood as protestors! #indyref

If there's a split in the UK it is between London and the rest of us, not between Scotland and the rest of us. #indyref

Let's get to the real question of this #indyref.will we still get The Great British Bake Off on our tellies?! #GBBO

Think of all the countries that fight for their independence yet Brown and Darling say its patriotic to #voteNo #Outragous #Indyref #VoteYes

1/3 of the UK may leave the Union tomorrow but it's just the Great British Bake-Off on #indyref #paradox #ScotlandDecides

I want independence but were not prepared for it yet. However, if it happens it has my supporta divided country achieves nothing #indyref

The night before the #indyref and the haar has enclosed Edinburgh - as if it knows our brains are cloudy with info and decision making.

Paul Mason is everything that Nick Robinson isn't. Perceptive, sharp and a brilliant communicator. #c4news #IndyRef

#indyref just remembered I can't stand listening to campaign speeches whichever side they are on. Change channel.

Plot Twist: Instead of No voters being called the silent majority, MAYBE they just don't exist. That's why they are quiet. #indyref #voteyes

Turns out is wearing a lucky loom band. Whit? #indyref

The BBC's shockingly biased coverage on the referendum will make a yes campaign victory even sweeter #indyref

#IndyRef Great night canvassing in Aberdeen, The positive was well received.

Well your judgement is clearly sound as far as #indyref is concerned - in that respect we're united!

Skype call with Slex Salmond. 'A true Scotsman will never say what's under his kilt'. But he did show me. #indyref

Salmond does not acknowledge democratic deficit of EU, of Holyrood Committee system, and does little to condemn political mobs #indyref

No supporters in George Square #indyref   Oh dear.//just looking for a fight

#indyref start a tit for tat on bully stories but  pointless. Both sides mostly decent but media biased

I seriously doubt Cameron could negotiate his way to the bathroom unassisted #INDYREF #eu #devomax #GE2015

Marching Yesers moaning again about the Beeb sound as if they're getting their excuses in first. Too close for both side's comfort #indyref

If this is the welcome Salmond is getting just now, I can't imagine how the Yes camp will react if Scotland votes for independence. #indyref

Looks like a fine day for an #indyref vote tomorrow in #Scotland ! #weatherforyes #getoutthevote

The Biggest Day in Scottish History. My balanced, calm  considered view.  #IndyRef #VoteYes #LetsDoThis #YesBecause

I'm not allowed to comment on #indyref vote. But I will say how inspired I am to see a whole nation engaged - young and old - in process.

Not looking forward to my mad dash home tomorrow afternoon #indyref

Had wondered why Gordon Brown kept low profile before. Better Together been needing this credible passionate appeal by fellow Scots #indyref

Salmond: This is the land of Adam Smith, which incidentally is why we find it so demeaning to be told we can't run our economy #indyref

Hope everyone has a good date with democracy tomorrow - regardless of your choice #indyref #gottalivetogetherafterthis

Errr none. Like asking how many will vote no hoping that more people have the cojones to vote Yes :-) #indyref

Nothing worse than someone who believes they're own pish #indyref

If Eritrea, East Timor, Montenegro  South Sudan did it then #Scotland can too! #indyref #Yes

Tomorrow be confident, be proud and vote No for a stronger Scotland  #BetterTogether #indyref

So proud of how my country has debated over past months.Personally hope we will still be UK on Friday,I think it's best for us all#indyref

Cameron says he won't resign if YES?  Err, Well he won't have to if he's given his cards by the scots at least #indyref

Best of luck to the people of #Scotland on their big day tomorrow. #indyref

#indyref is gonna be the most interesting thing ever tomorrow.

Can't help thinking about Neil Kinnock's 1992 Sheffield moment, when I see pre-election rallies #indyref

if theres any scots who follow me and the #indyref gets a yes vote, no hard feelings pls

Just a few months ago, the thought of a #Yesvote as a viable outcome of the #indyref was a pipe dream. Now it's too close to call.

Polling cards at the ready; fingers crossed for tomorrow. #Peace and #respect whatever the outcome #indyref

Do you know what's telling? The absence of any English analysis of how much better off they're going to be without us. #indyref

Well, just tweeted this photo of himself. How does he look? #indyref

Here's my take on why Scots should and will vote Yes on Thursday:  #indyref

Great to see the young people of Scotland having a voice. 16 years and over are eligible to vote. Ireland should take note. #indyref #vote

#indyref 'yes' campaigners favour more #immigration into Scotland; 58% of Scots favour reductions.

Every BBC topical comedy programme I've seen has been biased towards Scottish Independence!  WTF BBC?!  #IndyRef

The status quo and vague unprobable powers? Historic right enough. #indyref  #YesScotland

I bet Salmond feels like it's Christmas Eve ..#indyref

For the next 24 hours the streets of Glasgow will be like the purge. Seems the #YES voters have already attacked a number of ppl #indyref

Salmond reminds me of a a 'triumphant' Kinnock circa 1992. #indyref

Marvelous #indyref campaign from #YesScotland is just another reason I support #NoThanks ..#ScotlandDecides

I'm not Salmond biggest fan, but boy he's nailed this final speech. #indyref

I generally feel that national pride is stupid, but the past few months have made me proud to be Scottish #voteyes #indyref #AlbaGuBrath

Good advert for Fiat that thing made it from Barcelona :D #VoteYes #IndyRef #CatalansForYes

How much was this #Scottish  #indyref  who pays for it? The #SNP? The #UK taxpayers? Or just #Scottish?

News besides #Scotland #Indyref tomorrow: First court date for #Estonia-n officer kidnapped by #Russia  held since.

Should Alex Salmond resign if it's a 'No' vote tomorrow? #indyref

Hardly a rabble rousing speech from Salmond, more one of confident optimisation.#VoteYes #indyref

Taking #indyref to the extreme:  ''Kinky Sex Makes the World Go 'Round' #DeadKennedys #premonitions

#indyref Glasgow riots on Friday after a comfortable 'No' win, is my prediction.

You know what? Scotland is fucking jam packed full of eloquent, passionate people. Absolutely stuffed with them. #indyref

Thanks! Funny how people far away know more than those living 2.3 miles from the place. #indyref isn't about SNP  Salmond!

4.7million tweets say Yes is winning. We animated them at  #indyref

#Scotland: follow the vote for independence with live updates via  #indyref

I am making a pledge: Not one #indyref gag/pun tomorrow. Despite the likelyhood that Twitter has probably prepared a server solely for them.

Also great not to hear Caledonia, Dignity and all the other guff we have had to listen to in #indyref recently.

Looking at the pictures and videos of the rallies all over the country 2nite, there's no way this can be the prelude to a no vote #indyref

From this debating audience it strongly appears as though the Yes vote is where all the hotties are. Real issues #indyref

A lot of flat-earthery coming from yessrs on this #c4 #indyref debate.

Always love #tomorrowspaperstoday but uniformly dire covers for tomorrow - symptomatic of London-based media's tin ear approach to #indyref

I went to Westminster today and everyone seemed to be really nice! #indyref

Hoping beyond hope that tomorrow our Scottish compatriots help us stay a United Kingdom #indyref #bettertogether

So choose well, everyone because you won't get this chance again. We're still friends on Friday whatever happens. #indyref

You are exercising democracy - and the POTUS can express a logical view #NO #indyref

Vile scenes from the represented better together today at George Square. This is what we have to put up with in the future. #indyref

You can RT this to death on fridayYES= 57%NO=   43%81% TURNOUT#indyref

I'd say you could count on one gimpy 6 fingered hand from the outer Hebrides how many #indyref voters would be swayed by Obama

Is it shallow to say that #jonsnow suit was ill fitting and thus distracting me? #c4news #breakupno #breakupyes #ScotlandDecides #indyref

If I was Scottish, I'd vote yes tomorrow. At least a chance of representative politicians for a few years. #indyref

Surprised if Scots voting yes to solve poverty at home by upping sticks from rest of the family? Can #indyref inspire more united response?

Overheard a conversation outside Holyrood Media Centre. Well known London BBC presenter says they expect Yes win! #indyref #YesScotland

Thank you Sunday Herald. The professional journalism has been refreshing. I will continue to buy#Scotland#indyref#YES

Good proposal from for Labour to support a constitutional convention for England:  #indyref

Here's something I don't say every day (or ever). An excellent #IndyRef article on the BBC via  #voteYES

#Scotland. It could all end up a bit Lord Of The Flies y'know  #indyref

No campaign leaders 'like desperate boyfriends' according to #newsnight #IndyRef

Who is baking all these #indyref fairy cakes?

I think whether you need new locks on the door depends on how you feel about people repeatedly strolling in and raiding your fridge #indyref

Uh, what do you want/expect them to do? What flag should they wave? #indyRef #Saltire #Hijack?! #Offensive?

Say what you will about Scottish #IndyRef - it's refreshing to watch people engaging in political discourse with passion  gusto! #Newsnight

All that was missing was the DNA test results #thegreatbritishbreakup #indyref

vote yes to get rid of trident! it's fucking shite #indyref

brilliant job on this campaign mate, inspirational - hope over fear #VoteYes #indyref

I take great pride that my ward has the highest turnout in the City (although hardly at #indyref levels!)

No description necessary.  #Scotland prepares to vote. Tonight  #CBC #IndyRef

Please Scots..don't vote yes. If you do then Westminster elite will experiment taxes like poll tax on the north of England #indyref

On Friday if it's No I'll start campaigning for DevoMax. I hope No supporters can campaign for Scotland's settlement if it's Yes.#IndyRef

But, I'm only up because I'm wondering if will be going on holiday in time for #indyref result. Boom boom.

Well, lads and lasses, here we are on the eve of battle. Stand up Scotland! #indyref #yesscotland #carpediem #hopeoverfear

As importance of nation states diminish  world is run by big biz people seem more bothered about identity #indyref #eu #immigration etc

Allure of #yes #indyref is the promise of wondrous dreams. If Scots want out: Go, but the harsh reality will catch up with you eventually

Tomorrow a population of 6 million will be voting on the futures of 64 million. Please vote wisely. #indyref

myself and my family will be at the polling station in the morning #votingYes #indyref

DO NOT put a spoiled ballot in the ballot box; that is your vote gone. Take it to any official for advice and receive replacement.#indyref

No guarantees that the Scottish will be able to form this utopian society they seek. As a famous Scot once said #bestlaidplans #indyref

Maybe this makes me a small-c conservative in my attitude to political change. But I think this referendum has been rushed #indyref

All my (English) chums consistently  hoping Scotland  votes Yes !  Me ?  Couldn't possibly comment #indyref

Sinn Fein MLA on UTV The Issue discussing Scottish independence calling for a #borderpoll in Northern Ireland #indyref

A nice resounding No from the Scots tomorrow should help my foreign exchange prospects $$$ #indyref

Many thanks to all new people whom I've followed during the #Indyref and who have kept me informed and up-beat for supporting #NO and

Altruism central to Yes. Logical to denigrate that but it's a sentiment that doesn't *always* lead you off a cliff #indyref #whoknows

Thanks to #indyref Scots and Brits are now talking to and among each  other, questioning their status quo. Every nation should do this.

Past 30 years we've had PMs that have covered up child abuse, started illegal wars and cozied up to dictators. Better Together #indyref

I'm yet to see a #voteyes campaigner I'd rather be. I'm a #VoteNo #indyref #bettertogether #ScotlandDecides #Scotland #scottishindependence

No to business as usual. No to soaring inequality. No to the power, privilege and dominance of the 1% #YesScotland #indyref

Michelle Mone LOL!  Going at Brian Cox for not having a vote while sitting next to Rory Bremner #smh #indyref

Wish I had the day off work tomorrow. Would love to go cast my vote then spend the day at the pub! #indyref

more than welcome sir. Be sure to join us in the worlds fairest society. You're welcome. Everybody is. #indyref

No voters are coming across as douchebags. I know they're not but they're coming across like it. #indyref

That one bigot on Newsnight is doing some serious last minute damage to the No campaign haha #indyref #VoteYes

Love or hate him, this mans taken us to the most exciting day in Scottish political history. Cheers mate. #indyref

. No idea, nor do I claim to be especially informed about the #indyref. I find decentralization appealing. #scottishindependence

I cannot wait to tell my children about this amazing time. Hopefully while sitting in a thriving, independent Scotland. #indyref #voteyes

scots socialists whinge about suffering under tories when its labour that have caused their problems since 97 #indyref #newsnight

Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful  murder respectable,  to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.#indyref

As cowell regularly says on X factor it's a no from me #indyref

The Better Together folk doing Nazi salutes next to the Cenotaph showed more contempt for the soldiers who fought Nazism. #indyref

#newsnight At least the lady from Easterhouse will get a chance to speak with her vote instead of being cut short with her point #indyref

Forget the opinion polls - this is the ultimate piece of political research work of #indyref - Grindr users polled

#JKRowling's #indyref tweets make enjoyable  interesting reading, shame about the fucking mentals replying to them about Potter. Insane.

Seriously hoping we get independence tomorrow, think it's clear now that we are not better together #VoteYes #Scotland #homerule #indyref

if your head tells you one thing, and your heart another, follow your heart as your head has been manipulated by both sides #indyref

You could not make this up - the KFC fillet that is an omen for the Scotland referendum  #scotlanddecides #indyref

including a map of which countries are more #nothanks and which are more #voteyes in #indyref

Thank you  for running absolutely heart-felt campaigns and engaging us in a way I've never known. #indyref

There are loads of reasons to vote No (as well as Yes) but he picked marketing tag lines  gave no benefits to voting No #indyref

Best til last!  Nothing more poignant at this time than the Unionist Burns #nothanks #voteno #indyref

Fix problems locally and change them internationally..#indyref

too many people saying yes. Too many people wanting real change. Too many people full of hope, optimism and creativity. #indyref

My only opinion about #indyref is that I hope people can be happy with whatever is decided, and that it works out well for #Scotland

I still do but you he really should be voting YES. You no it makes sense? #indyref

You'll tweet march and cry over swapping Saltire for Union Jack but you won't lift a finger for Palestinians demanding real freedom #indyref

'We are masters of our our destiny' Go with your hearts! #HopeOverFear #indyref #VoteYes

#indyref AGAIN.Remember: It's not about the SNP. It's not about ConLabLibKip. It's about PEOPLE. Taking POWER back. #VoteYes

The newspaper industry remains alive and well in this country. Some sensational front pages on tomorrow's papers. #indyref

If Scotland gains independence, can we finally ditch the turgid crap National Anthem and replace it with something good? #indyref

#Newsnight debate shows the real divisions created by the referendum  scale of challenge to reunite Scottish people on Friday #indyref

Amazing coverage of the debate by Well done! #voteyes #indyref

#indyref #voteyes you don't need centralized banking and you have allot of natural resources we would be the ones needing you, #freedom

A No vote will haunt you forever. You know it will. #indyref

If yes win, will the BBC continue to broadcast BBC Scotland? #indyref #semiseriousquestion

I'm not voting for Salmond and despise Souter but firmly believe Yes #indyref can herald a new democratic energy

Well this will be twitter unused for next 36-48 hours, all this #indyref is a nightmare and boring as shit.know whatwhy im voting end off

When they leave the UK, they forfeit that. They cannot be in and out at the same time. #indyref

but if the no campaign now say they will give Scotland more powers, why did they deny us 'devo max'? #indyref

#indyref The Thing is on ITV4 if you want to know what it's like being stuck in an isolated place with people who are inhuman monsters.

all my Scottish friends proudly voting YES #INDYREF

Politics nerds like me r buzzing for tomorrow #indyref

I thought the Salmond /Sturgeon being childless was a joke until #newsnight allowed a bigot to offend decency spouting this crap #indyref

Whatever way the vote goes, we all have to wake up on Friday and live together.  Don't make divisions that can't be healed. #indyref

I'd be Yes. The fact that Scotland's a equal partner in the Union has been ignored by England/Westminster. Too late for platitudes #indyref

That referee from Indianapolis is sure stirring up the interwebs. #indyref

Shameless blog post self promotion - for the last time -  -  #indyref #VoteYes

I should really sleep now so I'm not a wreck tomorrow when I'll vote Yes. But sleep will be impossible #indyref #voteyes

A picture is worth a thousand words- My vote is YES tomorrow #VoteYes #VoteYesScotland #indyref #scottishindependence

I don't actually get a vote but even still I remain #undecided with regards the #indyref. This close to a poll it feels very strange!

no voters dropping off social media like flies because they 'can't take the harassment'. debate =/= harassment #indyref

#indyref its not just economics it is society Look to Ireland 1950's emigration worst decade since the famine'

Good night and good luck tomorrow everyone Remember hope over fear and whatever happens we are all friends come Friday #indyref #VoteYes

UNDECIDEDS: what major landmark, if projected onto, would persuade you to vote yes? #indyref

I'm a nervous fecking wreck over this #indyref *clings to Scotland's trouser leg*

No matter what happens tomorrow we need to pull together and move on. #indyref

That was some speech by Gordon Brown today! #scotland #indyref #staytogether

favourite tweet in the whole #indyref debate x x x

Having a punt that #IndyRef figures aren't going to be much different from those of the #AVRef2011. No to win by 2:1.

Say of the man what you will  but this was one hell of a speech! #VoteNo #IndyRef

I don't get some of the yes voters when they say the no voters are traitors. If they're so proud of their country, why change it? #indyref

With only a few hours to go, proper coverage and discussion really only just beginning to happen South of Border #indyref ..bit late no?

#IndyRef polling stations open at 7am 2moro and close at 10pm. Take your power back. Don't leave your destiny in the hands of #Westiminster

It does come down to a more basic political argument.  Is the State here to Protect us or Perfect us.#indyref

I'll just tag this with #indyref in the hope more people see it, chill out and get some perfection in their evening.

There are many degrees of with us or against us, but this ballot is black and white. Decide. Vote. #Indyref

#indyref  #ScotDecides  Positivity is easy to convey but blind.Negativity is balance - less attractive but realistic. Pause, think, Vote No

Us cartographers are waiting with bated breath #Maps : ) #indyref

Please, for all of us, Vote YES tomorrow.  Let's build a more equal, socially just society for all.  Do the right thing tomorrow, #indyref

It's not been two campaigns in a long time. It's been Better Together versus a movement. Old politics vs normal people. #VoteYes #indyref

Conflicted: Gordon Brown was adorable  my Scottish friends are voting #nobut is #yes. Good job I don't get a say #indyref

Three undecided voters won over by the YES voters on #newsnight and rejecting the negativity of Better Together #indyref #YesScotland

Gordon Brown. Where the hell have you been? Great speech. #indyref

Bo (isn't that the dug?) don't tell us what we can't do! #YesScotland #indyref

Scotland decides: A 'no' vote will lead to a significant transfer of power to London--the Qubec experience  #indyref

Smaller nations are leading by example. Scotland has what is needed to succeed in the world:  #indyref #sizematters

For 15 hours tomorrow the people of Scotland have complete control of their own destiny, and we should keep that power for good #indyref

Many people may genuinely lose their shit. Try to convert hamsters and what not. It will be a laugh #indyref

What is separating Scotland from UK: language, religion, currency, monarch, wealth, whiskey? For outsiders differences seem minor. #indyref

Tomorrow is a big day for Britain  Scotland.  #IndyRef If I had the chanceI would vote yes, what will you do?

We're no' awa' tae bide awa'. Or something. #indyref

2morro is the biggest day of Scotland's life. I'm voting #YES because smaller power structures are more effective. #indyref

You still don't understand the logic of it. Shame. Emotionally upset that it seems to have caught on? #indyref

If you've any undecided family members, fire on the Faddy France game. Job done. #indyref

Nearly everyone I've spoken to who are voting now, are doing so because of feelings, emotions and hate change. Terrible decision#indyref

In a week from now, #indyref will be mostly out of twitter's system. Can't wait.

How the Fuck I'm I meant to sleep tonight! #yes #indyref #Scotland

Be imaginative, people of Scotland. Don't be NOrrow minded. #voteyes#indyref

Nationalism really is quite ugly, it's such a narrow view #VoteNo #bettertogether #indyref

The #BBC should be prosecuted for its mangling of Scotland's #indyref. This has not been democracy. It's been a Tory omnishambles. #VoteYES!

Here's what the BBC did when a #VoteYes placard entered their pro-union propaganda shot #indyref

I never thought I'd be this excited by politics. Incredible what can happen when people feel empowered. Go and get it Scotland. #indyref

technically you are correct but up to people power on 18 September 2014 #indyref

A set of disparate groups have united behind the #yes campaign. They have all promised the earth. How can they all be right? #indyref

Crikey. Asked why Scots should vote No, Rory Stewart says so they have the chance to join the British army. #indyref

Hosting an #indyref party and you can all come. Sadly this isn't the sort of social media party invite that'll result in a trashed house

Anything less than an overwhelming No tomorrow will spell the beginning of the end for the UK #indyref

before i go off for the night(well before i try) any Scottish people, vote #YES in #indyref.. ye'll be a lot better off in the long run!

Incredible press release: Scot police tell media to stop beating up reports on non-existent 'trouble' around #indyref

Well the outrage over that democratic vote is what has landed us in this referendum now, isn't it? ^^ #indyref

So #Glasgow was very inspiring today. Loads of people with #Yes badges. Fingers crossed for tomorrow. #indyref #yesscotland #bittertogether

#indyref tweets shooting through my #tweetdeck right now are too frequent and fast to retweet. What will tomorrow be like?

COMING SOON: #Yes campaigners rally outside Edinburgh parliament on the eve of #indyref

I'm gonna guess, 58% 'No' to 42% 'Yes'. Any odds for this from the bookies? #IndyRef

Whatever the outcome on Friday, I am genuinely blown away by how many people are actually taking notice of politics right now #indyref

Twitter won't let me post my 3rd version of the toon - if Scotland stays in the UK. More:  #indyref

Whipping up hysteria. Same as the MSM have been doing over last few weeks. Arseholes!!! #indyref #VoteYes

So the time is almost here. Whatever decision Scotland makes, I will respect it. I just hope the final decision is the right one. #IndyRef

Scotland and #indyref both trending on election eve :)

I've never ever been to Scotland so I can't comment on how I feel about it, but I hope it's in good shape for when I do visit. #IndyRef

If there's one thing we can take away from all this - its that American news reporters can now say Edinburgh #IndyRef #greatbritishbreakup

As someone who grew up in Flanders and who lives in Catalonia, I find #IndyRef very interesting. Whatever you prefer, go and vote.

Its not about Ibrox or over there. Vote whichever way you see fit, but make sure you get off your fat arse and do it. #indyref #scotland

Doesn't stop some pro-Union broadcasters. Apart from tv's  coverage of #indyref has been disgraceful.

Now all is said and done. Whatever the result. Scotland must come together again. #indyref

let me guess? currency? #indyref #bettertogether not! #CatalansWithScotlandYes currency is not on the ballot!

Loving the optimistic energy flowing through Scotland these last few days #VoteYes #indyref

So sad about #indyref. Feel like I know deep down that Scotland are leaving us. Really hope you don't, but got to do what you think is best.

Scotland ndash; this is the time to rise out of the swamp that Westminster has become #indyref

Hey Scotland! Please use your vote carefully today - there's a right and very much wrong decision you can make! #indyref

Yes or No, it's win win..A Yes will be a smack in the mush for Cameron, a No will keep 40+ Labour seats for Ed in GE2015 #indyref

97% of adults in Scotland have registered to vote. Very interested to know % of turnout today.   #indyref

If Scotland goes independent, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO CAROL KIRKWOOD? #indyref

#SAVVY #indyref #VoteYes #LetsDoThis never before have I felt my vote could change my life and my children's life #OneChance

I am an American who is interested in this Scotland vote. #indyref

As Australia suffers despotic rule of London-born monarchist Thatcherite Tory - fingers crossed Scotland will give hope  #VoteYes #indyref

Seeing as #Donegal is about 25% Scots do we get a quarter of a vote in #indyref today? #ScotlandDecides

Scottish Tennis Superstar Andrew Murray says Vote YES #indyref

Come on scotland! Today is the first day of the rest of our lives #indyref #YesScotland

We didnt need to busload supporters into our campaign from england like milliband had,we got up and done it for ourselves #VoteYes #indyref

That's my yes vote cast. When this all kicked off I was a no. #indyref

How funny! Women joining the RA vote is today! Oh, hang on! That might get swallowed up by the whole #indyref thing!What bad planning!

Whatever the Scotland Independence opinion poll says, Westminster should just ignore it #BetterTogether #WeOwnYou #IndyRef :P

Proud of my wee country today. Queues at polling stations, huge engagement and maybe even women in the RA! What a day. #indyref #voteyes

My son and I have voted Yes for Scotland to become a fairer country for all. Join us and feel the joy!! #indyref #VoteYes #LetsDoThis

#indyref First day in weeks I have not been subjected to intimidation! Placed my vote.

The most striking aspect of the Scottish #indyref debate, is the astoundingly demagogic and populist tones and themes from both sides.

Got my best saltire-blue shirt on today! (Didn't go as far as to add a masking-tape cross to it, though :) ) #indyref

Officially on the rocks! It's crunch time for Chad Kroeger and Avril Lavigne. #indyref

it will be in the interests of the whole UK to have some form of reform following a #novote #indyref.

#VoteYes EVERY vote counts! Wake up the sleepy Remind the forgetful Go together +make sure everyone has voted! #indyref

Tonight i had a beautiful dream,  then Ive wake up to see that Scotland is living that very same dream today #GoForItScotland #indyref

English branch of MOSECON in Berlin to run the German office. German office in Edinburgh to report on #indyref. So Unbiased observation :)

Plus also we'll need some help to vote out this coalition fiasco. Cheers. #indyref

Labour for No outside Uddingston polling station. Where have they been all this time? #indyref

Good luck today, #Scotland. Sure it's only the most important political decision you'll make in your life #IndyRef

Baffling that Scots not living in Scotland don't get a vote surely they're entitled to a say in the future of their country. #indyref

Anyone fancy a wager on the turnout today? I'm guessing 70-75%. #indyref

I understand the Yes temptation with our broken political system. But borders can't deliver social justice. We can do it together #indyref

Today is our chance to create a country of true democracy, where we will be able remove food banks from our streets. #indyref #voteyes

That felt great!! #HopeOverFear let's get this done #Yes2014 #GenYes #indyref #WeAreScotland

it's not nearly as bad as most #nyt coverage of #indyref which has been ill informed at best  inaccurate at times

Oh no. I forgot today was a polling day. That means my instinct is to stay up for the result. A long day ahead then! #IndyRef

#indyref #vote done! What will tomorrow bring?! Either way is an incredibly exciting time to be in #Scotland #momentinhistory

I would hope that those voting 2day would have spent more than the 'last few days' weighing up pros/cons b4 deciding #indyref

So, when exactly would we get the chance to reverse a NO vote? #indyref

Whatever happens today, let it be a landslide. You don't wanna end up with a Scotland where half the voters hate the outcome. #indyref

Scotland, make your mark today in the ballot box. But remember you don't have to do it with blood. #indyref

Having conned Scots into voting yes turns to his advisors  says shite what do we do now? #indyref #itsnotaprotestvote

Grosser Tag in Schottland heute. #indyref - I want all the best for it to happen! #historicday #Schottland #Scotland

Here's where I am: I don't believe Scotland will fall into the sea if it votes Yes, nor do I believe it will be a utopia. #indyref

Happy voting Scotland, you have a full house of #Yes from us but let's not let this question continue to divide us after today #indyref

Sooo nervous for Scotland! Imagine having the opportunity to getting rid of Westminster and all the corruption it stands for! #YES #indyref

Good luck Scotland. Good luck UK. Good luck everyone. Peace and harmony #indyref

David Tennant makes a strong case for #nothanks  #indyref #BigBigDebate

NEWS: It's decision day for #Scottish voters as the polls open for the independence referendum    #indyref

#indyref So hoping Scotland votes not to break up the UK. Very much better together.

#indyref today every European should celebrate the Scottish referendum. If only the rest of us was allowed to vote on the EU similarly

Happy #indyref #Scotland , lets do this! The future is in our hands, no matter the outcome it will never be the same, gr8 2 c the passion

It's a momentous day today; that's right, I'm another year older. #indyref

Every single YES vote will serve as the heartbeat on our walk to a greater future today #VoteYes #indyref

Up early and rather eager to cast my vote, Can sense something special in the air in Scotland today! #indyref

Scotland, today is your decision which will mess up the rest of your lives if you choose wrongly #indyref

i expect a fucking good party when we become independent #indyref #VoteYes

My #VoteYes was not just for me but my late relatives who never got the chance and my future family yet to come. #indyref

Happy birthday to Mrs Lonie. 80 today. She is sticking with the union. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

37 people queuing outside Linlithgow polling station at 7am this morning - selfies obligatory #indyref

Video: What would happen if Scotland left the union?  #indyref

It would be disingenuous of me to say I don't care how you vote today but ultimately please just make sure you do #indyref #everyvotecounts

It's Yes day! I'm just up, but nice to see some tweets that folk have already voted #IndyRef #HopeItWasYes

Today will be forever known asmy birthday! Bore off Scotland #indyref

Forget the #indyref. We should really be focusing our attention on things that matter to the world.

Stayed up mega late in the hope of a long lie to prepare for next 48 hours non stop coverage. Wide awake. Buzzin. #indyref

I fear for Scotland trying to go it alone. This is for ever  it's a tough world out there. #Indyref

Wonder what  my Scottish friends are voting for today ? #indyref

Not sure everyone voting yes understand that Salmond and co have so little worked out. Vanity project #indyref #bettertogether

Be sure to follow + who are in Scotland reporting on #indyref vote today

Scotland will never be the same again, writes |  (RMC) #indyref

But campaigning is still going in. They're going down to the wire. #indyref

Every new government is a risk #Scotland becoming #Independent is no different #VoteYes #IndyRef #AnEnviousBrit

Good Luck Scotland. Which ever way it goes 'It's been emotional' #indyref

Have to say that as a graphic designer I'm chuffed with how my 'X' looked in that wee box. Perfectly straight and in Helvetica #indyref

Whole world watching us get dumped plse don't stick around for our ice-cream John Legend  pyjama slut-fest #indyref

I'd planned to wait until the workers had voted and gone off to work, but I'm to nervous. It's time. #VoteYes #indyref

Have you seen our blog about the #indyref and young people? #scotland #referendum

Solidarity with and #yes campaigners for all the hard work getting the vote out. Good Luck Scotland #indyref

Thoughts on #indyref intimately connected to a) widening inequality B) over-bearing London c) conundrum of globalisation = more localism

I hope my Nation stands together today to break the shackles of Westminster and the BBC. #billionairesboysclub #VoteYes #indyref

Wish I could do it again #voteyes #YesScotland #indyref

Pipe down chief, this is a referendum not a nightclub #indyref

Huge amount of scaremongering going on with the no side in the Scottish #indyref,Ireland certainly doesn't regret leaving the union in 1922

More music with no political undertones (to be fair just an awesome track you should listen anyway)  #indyref

Dear Scotland, Good luck today and may democracy win. Love from England, Wales  N Ireland xxx #FriendsWillBeFriendsRightTillTheEnd #indyref

Judging by the polls whatever the result around half of #Scotland will be unhappy with the outcome. Not an ideal situation really #indyref

#indyref begins  tomorrow morning we may wake and the land will have changed  only time will tell

#indyref no campaign missed a trick, should have published a poll saying English wanted a yes vote. Result would be a No just to annoy us

#indyref Scots. Go for the feat. Detach from the Tory teat. Don't deal with diamond-clad Dave  resign yourselves to Westminster's conclave!

I still think the whole of the UK should get to vote on Scottish independence as it effects everyone in the union #indyref

If you qualify for a Scottish passport, you should have been entitled to vote seems a simple enough concept. #indyref

good luck scotland, hope you make the right choice. just so you know though, as you have oil, The US will probs invade #Scotland #indyref

Wonder how long it is going to take to clean up the graffiti after #indyref?

Scottish independence :: Born, bred and migrated - there are many shades of Scottishness, but how wil  #IndyRef

You better be out there today with me! Convince just one more person today and it will happen! #indyref #VoteYes

Big day in history today. Great that 97% of those eligible have registered to vote #indyref #democracyatwork

I believe people can do better than we've done so far, and here's a chance to change the world #yes #indyref

ABSOLUTELY R A lot of us feel tired, worn out by campaigning. But chin up were British, Brits always win. #VoteNo. #indyref

This is it, Scotland. Carpe Diem. I'm nervous. I may not get to vote but I'm voting #Yes in spirit. #indyref

True colours of BritNats coming out now - Say what we want or begone - like North Korea - More #VoteYes fuel for #indyref Thanks!

This is what #democracy looks like: People registered to vote in the Scottish independence referendum #IndyRef

One way or the other, a 97% turnout is something which General Elections dream of. #indyref #Scotland

Snaps to the most exciting day in British politics #indyref IT IS UPON US!

Today is the day, but what IT challenges could an independent Scotland face? #indyref

England, you know how you argue like mad with siblings at home, then you move out  get on really well with each other? It's that. #indyref

Don't think voting NO today is negative. We will #voteno because we KNOW it is the right thing to do for Scotland #BetterTogether #indyref

I've never leaned so hard with a pencil in my life#indyref #voteyes

Oh the glamour of a 'dreich' day in Edinburgh! #indyref

Think Momentous Thoughts for our Scots Brethren :-) #indyref

So glad it's #indyref day today and that this whole fucking palava is almost over.  How ever it ends up its been a very annoying journey

Interesting to see how #ScotlandDecides in #IndyRef. Whatever the outcome, remember: all you need is hate:  #Delgados

* starts to divide up CD collection* #indyref

Imagine history happening to you, today #indyref

if we can all try to convince even one voter to vote yes then we've done or job. #indyref

I want to apologise to the world. I find this internationally embarrassing and morally outrageous.  #indyref #independencescotland

its all rubbish, isn't it? A couple of idiots, and it poisons the whole campaign #indyref

DB' s thought for the day: If Westminster had been Edinburgh based for the last 300 yrs would things have been any different? #indyref

For what it's worth I'd like you all to stay. #justsayno #indyref

Calling Scotland: if #VoteYes, then mark ballot paper anywhere with smiley face, if #VoteNo, then a cross in No box will do. #IndyRef advice

On the sidelines, holding my breath for the right result. Polls open in Scottish independence referendum.  #indyref

:-) #indyref - As you wish Scotland and best of luck with whichever it is! Here's a wee verse:

Facebooks being deleted for today! At least me Twitter feed is mostly rugby talk #indyref

If Scotland vote YES can we look forward to a Europe further Balkanized, more nationalistic.. Not a positive vision.. #indyref

Today's the day. Nothing left but to hope and pray that Scotland decides to stay part of the UK. #indyref #voteno #bettertogether

Don't screw it all up guys #indyref #scotland

#IndyRef Day. Whichever way it goes, there'll be ramifications for entire UK. Will it affect the average Joe though?

Ladies and gents, let's get out there today in our millions and ensure Scotland's better future! Vote yes! #indyref

Thanks for info on #indyref -- Ask the twitter and it will answer (sometimes)

all this money spent on merchandise should've just been spent on bribes #voteyes #indyref

Not worth paying any attention to. Those people would be vile abt something else this morning if #indyref wasn't happening.

Good grief. Australian lefties having kittens over #sydneyraids and getting just plain hysterical about #indyref. Clowns. #Auspol

My prediction is a #no vote. But I secretly hope for a #yes vote to watch how politics changes across the UK as a result. #indyref

Put on the news and nothing about the referendum? #goodmorningbritain #indyref

Went and voted this work #indyref  - am really excited, what a historic day

The Today Programme dull with hypotheticals now all has gone quiet on #indyref

they are being sold a dream but whichever way it goes there are huge ramifications for all of us in UK #indyref

Will Scotland take courage  flush out the banksters?#indyref

Me and Darragh Cuddihy pictured on Scottish #Indyref Day.

Goodbye political apathy (at least for a while). #indyref

Today's the day Scotland votes to become it's own answer, in its own right, on #indyref

Just helped decide my country's future. Pretty much a standard Thursday morning for me then #indyref

why keep making these 'balanced' statements when your newspapers are anything but? #indyref #bias

Happy #indyref, Scotland. We're all watching and waiting.

No, Salmond has nothing to lose today.  The people of these islands have a great deal to lose. #indyref

Good Luck today, Scotland. We're behind you. You can do it, mate! #YES #indyref

#indyref Andy Murray's Yes backing nowhere to be seen on BBC newspage hours on. Blatant suppression, the BBC is a compromised sham.

Polling is underway in the #indyref, with 97% of the Scottish electorate registered to vote, turnout is expected to be high.

Apparently there is a vote happenning in Scotland today? Did I miss something? #indyref

Whatever the outcome, good to see such a huge turnout predicted. At least the result will be truly representative. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Scotland's biggest decision in their history use your brains to vote not your heart #indyref

Voted YES in #IndyRef come on #scotland. Let's get this done once and for all. Excited for later see if we get it.

Right, I'm off home to listen to Caledonia, drink a single malt and stay up all night watching my people decide their destiny. #indyref #yes

WARNING! Do not photograph your ballot paper, it will taken off you and disregarded #indyref

It was an emotional experience casting my vote at 7am this morning but placing that 'x' in the yes box felt amazing! #voteyes #indyref

Come on Scotland! We're all behind you - hold your nerve and vote with hope. #IndyRef

Scottish friends: however you vote today, just be sure to get out and vote! Democracy is wasted on those who don't care #indyref

Post on Facebook to see if anyone wants to watch the #indyref results at mine. Mum angrily messages to accuse me of having a party. 1/2

za koga vi danas glasate  Here's a flavour of some of the #indyref newspaper front pages

No voters can make all the snidey comments they like about my tweets. Nothing will ruin the pure happiness I feel right now. #indyref #yes

Never mind all that. Will a Yes vote make scotch cheaper or more expensive? #indyref

'We are able to cover the whole of the UK as it stands this morning!' Mike Berthet on topic #indyref

First song thrown up by Spotify Shuffle this morning was Never Can Say Goodbye: maybe an omen? #indyref

Good luck today Scotland. What a unique privilege to choose independence democratically and peacefully. Make the right decision. #indyref

Whatever the #indyref result, I hope, and believe, that Irish people will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Scottish neighbours

Chickened out of my Betfair exposure on #indyref. Still have some toy money to play with on behalf of a friend in Germany, though.

It's twitter yes/no meltdown day, and that's all I'm going to say on the subject! #indyref

Scotland Let's Stay Together  Or, maybe we've come to the End of The Road  #Indyref

Go on Scotland make my day and mess up your future on the back of opinions and false hopes from politicians #indyref

Have they left yet? Can we talk behind their backs nowonly joking. Don't go Scotland I'm worried Cameron will ban Haggis in UK! #indyref

Whatever the outcome, thank you Scotland for giving Westminster a kick up the arse. Best wishes. #indyref

It is squeeky bum time for Cameron today #indyref :D

I'd like to thank Apple for giving me things to worry and obsess about other than #indyref today

Oh Flower of Scotland me arse if the Scots vote to stay under Westminister.Its use will be laughable.#indyref

#indyref BBC Media BiasLies taken as truthFear stirred logic deniedFrom Iraq to SavilleNever forget or forgiveOurs to be North Korea

I'm kind of excited (and worried) about the outcome of the #indyref today

it's the yes campaign that has been negative, using bullying and threats.You don't want whole of GB to support you now?#indyref

You clearly don't like us and the feeling is mutual here, however Scotland do the right thing and say 'No'we're better off together #indyref

Very curious about the #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef today. Good luck, I hope everyone votes and I hope the result is not as close as predicted

D-day! Which way will it go Anxiously awaiting the outcome of the #indyref

Ok fellow Scots, the big day is here, a momentous occasion and the end of a fantastic campaign. Please, if you have a vote, use it. #indyref

No surprise that Andy Murray is a #voteYes supporter but I imagine his PRs are totally reeling after all the legwork they've put in #indyref

#indyref - future of UK at stake  affects us all. Either way must force debate abt governance of all of UK/rUK. Hope we stay together.

If your heart says yes sod off. #indyref

GO VOTE! whatever you choose or result.. we're all gonna need to pretend to get on afterwards #indyref

Good luck to those campaigning on the #indyref today. I hope Scotland stays but either way I'm glad they've been given the choice. #justvote

Whatever way the vote goes I only hope the best comes for Scotland. #IndyRef

This vote could have earth-shattering ramifications for the Eurovision Song Contest. That's the real issue here, isn't it? #indyref

Whichever way the #indyref goes, about half the voters will be unhappy with their country's status.

It's going to be a long day with polling stations closing at 10pm. Feeling the whirly pits already. #indyref

Scotland #indyref : Voting begins.    #ScotlandDecides  Absolutely out-of-the-blue development.

Hate is a futile and wasted emotion and there's been too much around recently, disguised or otherwise. We're all better than that #indyref

So will be effectively screwed if Scotland vote yes because they have a large stronghold there. Please vote yes #indyref

No queue at the polling station, quick and painless #indyref

VOTE YES! And remember, you don't need a polling card- if you didn't get one, or lost yours, just turn up. #indyref #voteyes

Whatever the outcome, this is going to be a ball-ache for a long time. #indyref it doesn't just end with the result. #scared

Polls now open in #Scotland. The economist in me says no, but either way it's utterly fascinating to observe. #indyref #democracy #vote

Hi Dan. #indyref is our top story today, but polling day rules mean we're limited with what we can say - e.g no interviews

Morning one and all :) Massive day for Scotland In the words of The Clash Should I stay or should I go! #IndyRef

Salmon wants independence, but wants to keep British passports, keep British currency, keep The BOE. That is not independence #indyref #No

The final #indyref decision lies with Scottish people, but I hope we stay together and this campaign kick starts real change in the union.

Loving the Scottish #indyref coverage - external perspective v. welcome! Results expected at around 06/7GMT:

to all my scottish friends - I take the piss, but england is a toilet - crack on :) #indyref

Best way to start today? Appropriately named Queen - I want to break free #indyref

. millionaire who spends little time in Scotland votes Yes. He'll be ok whatever happens #indyref

If Scotland divorce England,  will they still have the kids (Wales and NI) every other weekend and pay child support? #IndyRef

Wings over Scotland - On them, readers. On them -  #yes #indyref

Dear Scotland, however you vote, don't let it be because you are afraid. You have nothing to fear. Ahead are only possibilities. #indyref

About 2 vote 'No'? Bad idea! Look around u. Almost every other single person is voting 'Yes'. Be positive! Embrace change #indyref #VoteYes

I have been to the polling station and exercised my right of suffrage #indyref

It would be sadly ironic if Scotland votes no but finds itself and the rest of the UK outside the EU in 5 years time #indyref

Seems to me like everyone who's gonna #VoteNo in the #indyref has been listening to scare tactics from biased media sources.

Whatever happens with #indyref it's highly likely a large minority of Scots won't get what they voted for, that can't be a positive thing.

The pull of freedom is very powerful when one is young #indyref

Coming up at 9 on I'll be reporting live from #Edinburgh with a look at the papers on #indyref day

It is, but I get the inside track from friends. Most of them just want the #indyref done  dusted now, whoever wins.

#indyref #VoteYes Where our voting friends in England lurch to the right Scotland does not want to follow!!!

As a dual citizen, if I was in Scotland today, I'd vote #Yes, for many reasons. So happy the #Scots have a choice #goyougoodthing #indyref

For years Irish road signs have warned the Scots would leave the Union. #indyref
