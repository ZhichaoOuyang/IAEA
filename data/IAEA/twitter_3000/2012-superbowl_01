I guarantee the #ManUtd v #Chelsea game will be 100x better than the #SuperBowl. More drama, way less commercials.

I couldn't care less about either team today. #superbowl #watchingandgaining10lbsanyway

Cant wait! the time is almost here #SuperBowl #PatsXLVI

#Trainhard  you know the Giants and the Pats did!  #fitness  #DoWork  #goal  #SuperBowl

Did you know: You're more likely to have a son who plays in the #SuperBowl than have a daughter who competes for #MissAmerica!

Rob Stone ur an idiot for thinking the #SuperBowl isn't gonna top that Chel vs ManU game. Soccer people aren't the smartest.

Today's prediction:  #Illini and #patriots both win.  Patriots win by more than the Illini though.  Pats cover, #ILL doesn't.  #Superbowl

Incredible game. Bring on the real sporting occasion of the weekend now. #superbowl

Apparently the #SuperBowl is today? Pretty sure not, cuz nothing is super without the #packers
