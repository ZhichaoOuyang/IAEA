Eeesh, these early returns are SO TIGHT. #Indyref

Great results UI by the BBC here:  #indyref

#BREAKING #Scotland #IndyRef MT Scotland's #indyref totals after 7 of 32 declarations:Yes 172,426 (49.1%)No 178,811 (50.9%)

#ScotlandDecides how are the votes tallied is it popular or like our electoral in the us #indyref

Yes campaign only 1,400 votes behind now, but they'll start to struggle from now on. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Another council says yes. Tides turning? #indyref

Ack! Was going to go to sleep, but #indyref is so close! Yeah, I'm a German/Sicilian New Yorker, but #DRAMA!

Clearly the groundwork from paid off in Clydebank #indyref

The YES campaign is gaining real fast #indyref

Good morning its 4am here, watching the results. #Indyref

The place where I spent 3 weeks working in Scotland, Inverclyde seems to have voted no but just barely. #indyref

Midlothian Results: Yes - 26370 No - 33972No carries another region.#indyref

Second yes victory, out of the 8 so fargetting close. Time enough still that anything could happen though. #indyref

Midlothian goes no - comfortable for better together #scotlanddecides #indyref

There's now just 1,441 votes separating #Yes and #NO, with #No currently leading #IndyRef

On my way to work early because I'm so keen for democracy #IndyRef

No big surprise that #WestDunbartonshire went the way of the #YES campaign. #IndyRef

Who are these zoomers that are voting yes AND no? Jebus wept. #indyref

A win for NO in Midlothian! By a fair margin too 56/44 #indyref

I thought it was a definite no victory until about 10 minutes ago. #indyref is getting tense.

Exhausted yes campaigners find energy for a big cheer over west Dumbartonshire #ScotDecides #indyref

Midlothian votes 33,972 No to 26,370 Yes. Big win for No campaign #indyref #ScotlandDecides

This vote is actually so close! Crazy to think the independence of a nation is based on a yes/no vote! #indyref #unitedkingdom #notsounited

Scotland should have declared a bank holiday for tomorrow I'm English but can't go to bed  #indyref

Less than 1500 votes in it now. Whoever is booking this is doing a great job, surely better than whatever did this year #indyref

Midlothian votes No 56%. #indyref Gladstone would be pleased.

Midlothian sets YES campaign back significantly. Consensus is it will be v hard to pull ahead, but big Councils still to come. #indyref

ya wee smasher west Dunbartonshire #indyref

#Scotland you are killing me right now. Next time please do electronic voting. #indyref

We need Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen.. #indyref

I really should be in bed right now. I'm so going to regret this in the morning #scotdecides #indyref

#indyref. More results coming very soon. 9 declared out of 32 : 51 No, 49 Yes. No pattern emerging.

I wish they wouldn't keep talking over the reasons for rejection :/#indyref

Midlothian, you're getting annexed, 'cept the Heart bit. I love the Heart of Midlothian. #indyref

A few hundred slightly sozzled Yes supporters remain in St George's Sq. The mood remains defiant despite the results so far. #indyref

Yes 49% and No 51% after 9 (out of 32) councils counted. #indyref

Previously rather reserved opposing campaigns in #southlanarkshire have now taken to cheering each result as it comes in. #indyref

Minutes away from ED result #jpScotRef #indyref

Just got up for a glass of waterWas not expecting votes to be so close! How to get back to sleep now?! #indyref

What happens if the vote is actually 50-50? #indyref armwrestling?

Glasgow and lanarkshire will blow us into independence! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Muscle borough!!!!! Where's my Oyster Card? #indyref

Scotland's #indyref is the most important thing happening rn tbh

BBC is really covering #indyref exactly like Sky does on Deadline Day.

Need to sleep but it's so close I can't pull myself away!! Do the right thing our Scottish family!! #bettertogether #indyref

Story of how once solid Labour Dundee became an SNP  indepedence stronghold over past 17 years is triumph of ground organisation. #indyref

Right now we're enjoying the hospitality of for the #indyref; remember to get to sleep before our mini race and social tomorrow!

So far: 'No' is winning with 241,559 (50.95%) votes. Yes is just behind with 232,516 (49.05%) #IndyRef #scotdecides

Why have the tweets in#IndyRef dried up. Has everyone gone home?

Current TotalYes: 232,516No: 241,559This is absolutely brilliant! So close#Squeakybumtime #Indyref #ScotlandDecides

Still less than 10,000 difference at this stage. No swings. No trends. Every vote counts. This is politics #indyref

I was worried there would be nothing to see, but this order of results is good #indyref

No currently leads by 1.90750408690608% if you were wondering #molliedoesmaths #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Actually I'm not sure many of them know the results so far, they are too busy singing. #indyref

Right, let's go old school rules, next goal wins #indyref

Midlothian votes No, and as it stands at 4.13am, there ain't a lot in it. YES: 232,516. NO: 241,559. #IndyRef

Wonder how many YES voters will be moving to Dundee? #indyref

#indyref looks closer (51% to 49%) than it really is because the only big councils to report have been Yes-friendly.

This is not good for when is poking fun of its math on #indyref!

Breaking: Following just 1 yes vote to 6 no votes the race has become extremely tight:YES - 49.1% NO - 50.9%#ScotlandDecides #indyref

Ohemgee I am so nervous, lol #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Can't watch the votes despite being awake the tension is killing me  #indyref

Dundee is the first to vote yes! More to come?  #indyref

Well at least Dundee voted yes #indyref

Listen #indyref voters. You just have to.. BOLIEVE

So many of the local councils have attractive logos #IndyRef

#indyref stressing me out rn pls stay together for the kids

I'm in Chicago; it's a little after 10 pm here! My fellow American tweeps are following #indyref

I can't help being intrigued by all these people who tick both boxes #indyref

On the edge of my seat. I'd have a stiff drink but just ate half a jar of Nutella. #cliffhanger #nausea #indyref

That's a big No vote from East Lothian. #indyref

So glad I am not driving right now #indyref has me on edge of my seat, until cities come in this is going to be close

Catnapping and then refreshing twitter feed. Less than 1% in it. #indyref #Scotlanddecides thank god for twitter. Nervous.

Sterling firms as early results go against Scottish independence: TOKYO (Reuters) - Sterling rose to   #indyref

You too East Lothian. Thank you! #indyref

Its goin pear shaped again #indyref

BREAKING: East Lothian has voted NO, 44,283-27,467. #IndyRef #Scotland #ScottishReferendum #ScotlandDecides

So #yes takes a battering from East Lothian.. What a difference 5 minutes makes #indyref

That's a really hard result for the Yes campaign in East lothian #indyref

Anyone know what time Glasgows results come out #indyref

Contingency shopping list - paddle, air-freshener, improved SatNav (with creeks) - on hold #indyref

Ouch. That was a crushing defeat in East Lothian. #indyref

Sky News coverage of this morning's Referendum declaration from Orkney.#indyref

#indyref key outcome so far: East Lothian can't afford a lectern

Markets currently pricing in a 98% chance of NO. However over/above 45% YES vote threshold is a coin toss #indyref

Anyone know what position various labor unions took on the Scottish #indyref?

East Lothian's results are in. A big No with 44 283 compared to 27 467 for Yes #IndyRef

The Hearts of Midlothian, stay with the British, voting no. #indyref

Solid result from East Lothian - no: 62% #indyref #indyrefallnighter

#indyref Ok starting ta think we've bottled it and the NO's will win. Boo, but such is life. time ta fix our sorrows. anybody got any smoke?

Who else is watching Braveheart tonight? #scotland #indyref #scotlanddecides

#indyref results - more in, Stirling is very pink has declared that it is a NO.

Way to GO DUNDEE!!! previous to tonight I said I did not care which way Scotland voted (since I'm American) but apparently I do. ##indyref

We are only just over 1000 behind! #indyref

Holey Jebus!My apologies to for all my frantic texts re #indyref. I'm so on edge!

Stirling's got to be no, surely? Aaaaand I'm right. #indyref

Sterling:Total: 62225Turnout: 90.1%Yes: 25010NO: 37153The NOES have it! #indyref

East Lothian also goes big for NO.#indyref

Breakfast time in Chiang Mai, Thailand. All activities postponed until the vote has been declared. #indyref

The first Scottish friend I ever made was from East Lothian. Friend no more it seems! #indyref

Shit's hitting the fan now. I love it when the results start to avalanche in #indyref

Fingers crossed the #indyref can spark the debate for an #EnglishParliament.

Stirling votes solidly NO with a massive 90% turnout #indyref

I really know nothing about it, but, is #Indyref shaping up to be a battle between the cities and the countryside/islands? #ScotlandDecides

The BBC keep cutting to some mad, drunk NO woman at the Better Together gathering. It's like The Exorcist. Rag-doll. Honestly. #indyref

Is that the biggest differential margin so far in #EastLothian? Coming out for No. Oh and Stirling a No too. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

All this cheering is very un British #thisisntthecolonies #indyref

Stirling goes No 30,733 (60%), Yes 25,010 (40%).  A big win #IndyRef #BetterTogether

's benchmarks an incredibly helpful guide to interpreting the results as they come in.    #indyref

With so many people in Scotland watching #indyref through the wee hours, they really should have cashed in with a Telethon, too.

#ScotlandDecides: Sterling votes NO with 59.77% on a turnout of 90.1%. This takes the NO lead to 43%. #indyref

BREAKING: Stirling has voted NO, 37,153-25,010. #IndyRef #Scotland #ScottishReferendum #ScotlandDecides

Stirling: 90.1 percent turnout rateYES: 25,010No: 37,153another NO vote. #indyref

Another couple of wins for NO, in East Lothian and Stirling. Phenomenal 90% turnout in the latter. #IndyRef

Results coming in thick and fast now! Still close to call, though it's looking like a no. #indyref

Stirling comes in to declare 59.77% #NO and 40.23% #Yes. Always lovely to see results trickle in #indyref #ScotlandVotes

At this rate, im not gonna be able to look into fellow countrymen in the eye again. #indyref #poorshow

Looking like Scotland wants to have its cake and eat it #vote #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref #ScotlandDecides East Lothian and Stirling are both NO. (62% and 60% respectively). Things are really heating up!!

Very sweet that Stirling has a heart in the g. Shame about the result, though. #indyref #YesScotland

Every time I hear people cheering a No vote I feel physically ill. When we get a Tory/UKIP coalition you fucking remember tonight. #indyref

Good morning! Think the writing might be on the wall for us, but goddammit, we have fought bravely. #indyref

Biology on one side, coverage of the Scottish independence vote on the other. This is the life! #IndyRef

One thing for certain with these #indyref results is that the turnouts are amazing. Really is democracy in action .

Now we're picking up the pace :D #BetterTogether #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Stirling keeps the stabilisers on the bike and and pees all over the saddle #indyref

Let's get the Glasgow vote up in here #indyref

And just when you think it's tightening, it widens again. Results so far: Yes 46.87%, No 53.13% #indyref

Stirling (1.6% of registered voters):Yes 40.2%No 59.8%Turnout 90.1% #indyref

Has No underperformed their recent poll numbers in any districts yet? Doesn't seem like it. #indyref

Scotland the Brave. What a fantastically close result. Best of Three?! #indyref

if I had a dug I would take it for a long walk now #tooclosetocall #yesdundee #indyref

Will give it a switch, BBC should do what they do with F1 and have alt commentary via the red button #indyref

A Kurdish Exodus happening in Kobane by #ISIS attacks. Where is promised coalition?   #IndyRef

Got a bit close for a while but NO now winning overall according to my book 53.6% to 46.4% #indyref

in DC watching the #indyref, definitely not completely shitfaced

Yup. But less than 10% of results announced. Cities are wildcards. West Dunbartonshire going Yes was a big surprise. #indyref

Overall figures are now No 53% Yes 47% - looking much better again #indyref

Did someone at told Kay Burley to go to bed early? I hope so #indyref

Sarah on Results show really knows what she's talking about - wee bit of history and politics - love it #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Alex Salmond now 3/1 to resign as First Minister before end of the week. (Paddy Power) #indyref

Urban Councils yet to report (+ Glasgow) Via Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Fife #IndyRef

Massive win for the #NO campaign in #Stirling! Big margins coming in now. #IndyRef #ScottishReferendum

I'm really loving the updates on #indyref by town (county? Shire? It can't really be shire, can it?) guys, keep it coming

Beaten by exhaustion. Heading for bed. Look forward to final result tomorrow. Expecting No to win but by what margin? #indyref

#IndyRef  looks like the cities are going YES

Total is now back to 53% No, 47% Yes. But every vote counts and any region could change it. #indyref

Looks like tatties o'er the side #indyref

With 11 councils reported, 16.5% of vote, Yes on 46.9% - ABC prediction 47.2% - results at  #indyref

BBC coverage of #indyref summing up whole ethos of both campaigns for me. No celebrate in corporate hotel rooms, yes art students in a room

There is still a ton of time, but NO is looking more likely. #indyref

Best+fastest+most upfront info source for #ScotlandDecides =Twitter. #indyref

It's not how many votes each side receives, but how those numbers compare to the model that would generate a Yes win. .#indyref

Watching initial #indyref results, I am reminded that the picture previously painted by (social) media may not be quite true in real world.

Sterling voted No, now over to Lambert and Butler to get their results #indyref

So I guess England were the real winners of Bannockburn. Only took 700 years to decide #indyref

Send it to Dundee. Students, eh? Some thanks for free tuition! #indyref poll

another blow out but this time in Stirling. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Current national vote stands 53% for No, 47% for Yes. #indyref #skyelections

West Dunbartonshire votes YES in Scotland's #indyref:Yes 33,720 (54.0%)No 28,776 (46.0%)Turnout 87.9%bbc

My predictions for tonight were 52% no and 48% yes. I hope I'm wrong and it works out otherwise. Looks increasingly unlikely :( #indyref

East Lothian vote an overwhelmingly No by a margin of 44,283 to 27,467 in #indyref

Last #indyref tweet before bed. Indiv. regions indicate 'No' win. But overall right now: just 51-49 'No'. Glasgow  Edinburgh left

Stirling: 'No' victory; 90.1% turnout. 60% NO (37153) vs 40% YES (25010). 11 of 32 declared #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Watching Scotland's #indyref closelycould be historic with far reaching implications.

After 11 declarations - Yes has 47 per cent and No has 53 per cent #indyref

#indyref results coming in thick and fast now. Falkirk big No by 8K votes

Falkirk declare and vote NO:Yes 50,489No 58,030#indyref

No surprises in Midlothian and East Lothian but surprised at differential between Yes and No in Stirling. #indyref

The latest #indyref results have pushed the #novote to 38,002 votes ahead overall.#ScotlandDecides #referendum #VoteYes #VoteNo

Best part of live #indyref results: the announced explanations for rejected ballots. Voters checking both Yes  No win every time.

Trying to find a US 24-hour news network covering #IndyRef results. Nope. All non-news crime shows and opinion shows from hours ago. :(

In the Rose and Thistle pub, watching the #indyref results.

Glued all night to the #indyref results from the Mourne Mountains - NI. Fascinating stuff - but think 'NO' will win. It's so close though.

Also realised my entire knowledge of Scottish geography comes from football #indyref

Another great win in Falkirk! Feeling good now #indyref

Falkirk votes No #indyref with a 8,000 vote margin.

Oh, Scotland. I wish you had the faith in you I do. #indyref

Starting to look like a no. Still got a long way till 1 a.m. ET., for official call. Anything can happen. #ScotDecides #indyref

Falkirk reporting. Per  YES would need 56% here to win 50% countrywide. They're loosing to NO, 53-47%. #indyref

I hope you are enjoying NY and #indyref coverage! :-)

Falkirk is a No ! It's fucked now, I'm getting some sleep ! #indyref

Utter disbelief here in Edinburgh that Stirling voted No. #indyref

Huw loves his reaction shots #indyref

#Falkirk votes no! My home town (in the voice of Adele) #indyref

Falkirk also a No; that's a big gap. Our own Aberdeen due in about ten minutes, we hear - stick around! #indyref

Round of applause for Falkirk. No spoiled ballots - top of the class. #indyref

Waiting for Salmond at Ingliston. He's just out of sight but keep hearing cheers from supporters #indyref

So, looking like no win in the #indyref - I think I like that outcome. (Speaking as a non scot, who has only been there once!)

Even if Glasgow and Edinburgh are voting yes, the amount of regions voting against, may not be  ignored #indyref

Is this weather a bit like the #indyref ? A load of noise and an attempt of disruption #poor #shutup #thunder

Falkirk (122,457 electorate), a big one, says NO too #indyref

wahtever way it goes, its beautiful #indyref

Falkirk 53% votes No, turnout 89% #ScotlandDecides #indyref (Very interesting results)

It's really weird to be home at 4:20am after a long night out and still find everyone I follow currently tweeting because of the #indyref

Last 4 results have given 'No' a 2% swing which may prove very significant #indyref #Scotland #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

We're eating homemade haggis sausage rolls. YES to these! #indyref #ScotDecides

Nicola Sturgeon watches the results come in from a balcony at the Emirates Arena Glasgow count #indyref

Sipping a Fraoch heather ale and watching the #indyref results roll in.

This #indyref is going to come down to how much Yes win Glasgow by.

Ouch  Stirling? A no? William Wallace will be turning in his many graves #indyref

Falkirk seals it. I concede. The British state won this one. But the core vote for change pretty significant #indyref

They good to reliant on them when they was nothing else going on, now they're getting in the way of some actual analysis #indyref

why using crap mobile phone cameras to broadcast live? Can't hear anything! All just noise #indyref #crapsound

I can't sleep. Watching the #indyref on Sky News is fascinating stuff!

Thank you for rebroadcasting the BBC TV stream tonight for #IndyRef

Once again disgusted coverage of the referendum. Patronising  dismissive. #indyref

A series of big results for the No camp #indyref Shift flying in tonight, all the latest in here:

When a total result sits at 49.8/50.2, I start having dejavu chest pains ;) #indyref #Quebec95

Helpful interactive #indyref graphic: sort by council, by # of voters, etc.

Considering only 2 councils returning a yes majority not bad to only need a 3.19% swing to take the lead #indyref #VoteYes #YesWeCan

This is the SNP's right wing vote. It probably doesn't relish the Socialist Republic of Team Salmond. #indyref

Yes Jeremy, let's find out what the poor people are doing. #indyref

To all my haggis-eating bagpipers out there: vote Yes! #indyref

Here's how the voting breakdown looks by council as of 11:24pm EST #indyref

I think we are starting to see a trend of No #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

Every cunty thing Westminster does to us from now on, you no voting fucks chose that. Bra-fucking-vo. #indyref

Switching to BBC now - really couldn't put up with Jim Murphy at this point #indyref

Definitely going to reiterate that the final tally will probably be 53.something% NO to 46.something% YES. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Rumours of a Glasgow declaration in the next 30 mins. Make or break time already? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I need follow-up on that Felkirk polling place that closed hours before the deadline due to 100% turnout. Yes or no? #indyref

#indyref I just really want to see that dishfaced asshole resign

Still waiting results for big councils such as Glasgow #ScotlandDecides #indyref

The BBC does voting graphics much better than American cable news. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Ah, Jeremy's big blocks are back #indyref

Having deviated from BBC Butlerian calculations, I predict 'No' will win by 57.4% of the vote. #indyref

45,542 votes between Yes and No. No leading 53% to 47%. Glasgow would need to deliver like a 10% difference to cancel that out. #indyref

Think them numbers have come from CNN too, if they both have the same numbers that's 50/50 isn't it? #indyref

Jeremy Vine is going to be encased in graphs by the end of the night #graphjailcell #indyref

Most (not all) politicians now talking a lot of sense. Pity they couldn't manage to do that before the #indyref

#indyref if this goes like a Westminster election, the snp are in trouble.

12 of 32 councils declared: the balance leans again towards NOYes 46,8%No 53,2%Turnout 86.5%#indyref

Great Scot! Going to stay a United Kingdom. #indyref #UK #Scotland

Aiye! I don't think anyone tuned into the latest #BBCQA on #IndyRef ! xx

Keep the live updates coming-Canadian scots watching! #indyref

Past the point of no return. No point sleeping now. Coffee, blanket and moved to the couch. #indyref

It's 2014 and they're really counting those ballots by hand in Scotland? #indyref

A total of 254,163 votes cast in Fife - a turnout of 84.1% Results to be announced in due course #indyref

Jeremy, naff off and take your social grades with you for goodness sake! #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Proud of West Dunbartonshire, voting Yes for a fairer more democratic society #indyref

Loving the chance to sink my teeth into the #indyref aftermath.  If #wales were voting I would not be in #canada right now.

Angus council reporting results now #indyref

Current Total: 04.25amYes: (2) 335,482No: (10) 381,025Still not a lot in it!#Squeakybumtime #Indyref #ScotlandDecides

Angus and Aberdeen vote NO - huge margin for No in Aberdeen #indyref

I meant change the other way. #eyeroll #indyref #YesScotland  Angus ;S

Via Hands down one of the best pictures I've ever seen #Scotland #indyref

East Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire, and Fife expected soon. #indyref

After 12/32 the results are: NO 381,025 53.18YES 335,482 46.82Thus we have a narrow lead for the Nos. #bettertogether #indyref

Spoke to a couple of 50yr SNP supporters today who have changed to No in last year. #indyref

it's pretty unlikely that we'll end up with anything like balanced #federalism. Long road ahead #indyref

Scottish election turnout is approaching 90%.  What gods do we have to worship in the US to get turnout like that? #indyref #SacrificeAGoat

I can't believe that cities announce their voting results at a press conference. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Stockholm Syndrome just got a new name- thanks, Scotland. #indyref

What was that all about from Jeremy Vine. Very strange. #indyref

Angus - big majoirty for 'No' in Angus, 10,000 majority. 56% of the vote #indyref #Scotland #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

Four ballots made a mark that identified the voters? What did they do, sign their cross? #indyref

Aberdeen says NO to independence by more than 20,000 votes#indyref

Almost bed time but NO is going to hold out in Scotland. #indyref

Goodnight Twitter - Love you, and #Scotland too. #indyref

BBC's Sarah Smith, ex-C4, is fantastic on tonight's TV election coverage. #indyref

My hometown, Aberdeen, goes for No by 84,098 votes to 59,390. #indyref

Aberdeen, the Stavanger of Scotland, was not too keen on independence  #indyref Clear momentum with No vote now

Angus decides. Turnout: 80,302 (85.7%) Yes: 35,044 (44%) No: 45,192 (56%). The No's have it. #ScotlandDecides #Scotland #indyref

#indyref Using the SNP support numbers I project 99.8% chance of a no vote after the Falkirk result.

Best overnight twitter feed ever. Fact. #indyref

I know it's pretty earlier to call, but my gut says No wins the #indyref cc #RefTV Hoping I'm wrong. Will probably be close, though!

Aberdeen, my Scottish home town, votes decisively #nothanks! Well done, Silver City. #indyref

Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. *stares at tv*. #indyref

This #indyref is actually making me really nervous This is so historic and due to twitter I can track it. What is this 21st century?!

Wow Angus - thought that was a dead 'Yes' cert. #indyref

#indyref I must be a masochist watching indyref results on BBC !

Angus is the 13th council to report. 56.3% No, 43.7% Yes. #indyref

Overall Totals:NO: 426,217 (53.4%)Yes: 370,526 (46.5%)13 of 32 Declarations made#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Starting to look a little bit dire :P #indyref

I might have got those numbers wrong. Very very hard to make out and Sky didn't bother to report on screen. #indyref

ooh, Dumfries and Galloway goes No in a big way. #indyref

Had already typed up that Angus had said #yes had to change everything. #indyref #bettertogether #ScotlandDecides

I love you Angus. And Aberdeen too. And DG ! Results coming too fast #indyref

Is it sad that I have stayed up to watch Scotland decides - NO. #indyref

haha! Well I do love a bit of #indyref gossip. Though I guess it will be assessing the damage come tomorrow..

Can I blame the farmers? I think I'll blame the farmers #indyref

the gap is getting wider, still we're only 14/32 though everything could happen #indyref

Looks like the #NO #bettertogether vote may just squeeze to victory. Still a long way to go. #indyref

Bloody thunder and lightening has woken me up! Oh well, put the telly on, watch the results flow in #indyref #bettertogether

Can't keep my eyes open. I wonder will I wake to a huge twist in the morning. Lol #indyref #Scotland

Came home to vote simple as that ! Pay ma taxes entitled to have my say unlike you ! #indyref

With 19 more districts to go, NO leading with 53% support #indyref

In the office all alone for  #indyref liveblog. Powered by Earl Grey  peanut butter and jam sandwiches

90k lead now. Fat lady has finished her encore. I'm away to bed.#indyref

Funfact: The U.S. outlawed haggis in 1971. For some reason we think it's worse for us than McDonald's #indyref

So upto now the kindom is still united  #AlexSalmond is still hoping there not when the #indyref is done  dusted. #ScotlandDecides

So Alex Salmond's own area significantly in favour of No! #indyref #surprise

BREAKING: Dumfries and Galloway has voted NO, 70,039-36,614. #IndyRef #Scotland #ScottishReferendum #ScotlandDecides

dear this is how you do voting results #indyref

#indyref That's it dance the night away, we could still be in the UK at this rate

Almost 100 000 ahead for NO as Scotland decides. #indyref results East Renfrewshire now and it's a very well spoken lady with a No.

So it's not pronounced dumb fries then, ohh, well I never! #indyref

Gap continues to lengthen for NO to #scottishindependence  after 14 counts! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I understand voting void cause you don't agree with either option, but why vote for both and waste your vote? #odd #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I'll never understand how people can celebrate their own country rejecting independence. #indyref

Wow - it has gone from truly #squeakybumtime to a fairly large lead to the #VoteNoIs it all over? We will have to wait and see #indyref

East Renfrewshire No idea where the flip you are but you're cool. #indyref

Another amazingly good result, absolute rejection of the Yes campain by 66% (No) to 34% (Yes) #bettertogether #nothanks #indyref

Whatever #Scotland  decide just pleased to see a high turnout most above 86% #indyref shame we can't get that in a general election

Sad fish.  First photo of Alex Salmond as Scotland's #indyref declarations continue

Total votes are Yes: 407,140 and No: 496,256. 14 votes have been declared. #ntfm #indyref

Angus votes NO by a clear marginYES 35,044NO 45,19285.7% turnout  #indyref

And the results from East Renfrewshire are ina resounding No #indyref #jpScotRef

It's a NO from DG 70,039 said no thanks. #jpScotRef  #indyref

The Scottish Independence vote has certainly made up for a shitty Thursday nighter in the NFL #indyref

East Renfrewshire great turn out and great rest for #nothanks #indyref

Someone just got a text in East Renfrewshire #indyref #birdwhistletexttone

#indyref never mind more powers for Scotland, this looks like a mandate for Westminster to shaft Scotland further.

#indyref the biggest concern has to be how many people can't fill out a 1 answer voting slip properly

Switched to STV to find that they're actually declaring live. BBC two constituencies behind #indyref

Up to 55% No so far, looking promising! #indyref

It's a dry humping now I think irrespective of what Glasgow does. #indyref

East Renfrewshire votes NO: 63% over 36% (with a 90% voter turnout) #indyref

Dumfries and Galloway overwhelmingly rejects independence in #indyref with 70,039 votes to 36,614

Realise I was hoping for an upset in Scotland. Feeling slightly let down #indyref #probablyforthebest

Labour members apparently dancing about celebrating with Tories, makes you sick. You sellout, pathetic wankers #indyref

Och I fell asleep for 2 hours. #indyref

All that shouting and hollering #VoteYes, #Voteno moved in silence. #Indyref

go our home councils!! #indyref #bettertogether xx

And with a wimper the Scottiah people handed all they hold dear over to England for the rest of time #indyref

im for real on the edge of my seat with this scotland #indyref

Guardian is giving the best coverage on Scottish referendum. #indyref

These are big majorities. This is now only going one way. #indyref

It doesn't look good 4 the #yesvote 2 win the referendum but I am proud that my local area has decided 2 #VoteYes #indyref

Loving #indyref tour of ancient British Isles. An obscenely early morning #ff is in order.

cant work, too busy following #indyref

East Renfrewshire is another region voting no #indyref

When do we get an English parliament to decide where all OUR tax revenue is spent (such as on nothing north of the border)? #indyref

Soooo tied bht wanna stay up to see what happens #indyref

My 15yo is still up + completely distraught her disappointment at thistage is breaking my heart as the future she saw slips away #indyref

Can't believe how many people have actually shat it. Was feeling so positive 6 hours ago and now feel nothing but sick. #indyref

Scotland the Brave? Well we can't call ourselves that anymore #indyref

Sorry YES, Steiner's army isn't coming. #indyref

East Renfrewshire said NO. As has East Dunbartonshire and,significantly,Aberdeen. Over halfway now. #indyref

I never thought I'd see this at the halfway point! 56% to 44%! #IndyRef.

Pssst: most of Scotland lives in Glasgow and Edinburgh. And Edinburgh doesnae coont #indyref

No is going to take it by a wider margin than predicted.  I am going to get some sleep; Scarborough Toyota awaits me at 07:00. #IndyRef

After a brief moment when the YES/NO gap closed, some big NO results have just come in. Currently YES 490817 (45%) NO 622040 (55%). #indyref

Rangers might want to get in their own Prem Lge first. MT no way glasgow vote yes b/c both teams want to join the BPL #IndyRef

Damn! What's up with Scotland ? You had a great chance to get the Tories off your backs and yet you choose to stay ??? #SCOTDECIDES #indyref

Anyone else in London woken up by that #storm earlier on? Some sort of #IndyRef omen?

If the people of Scotland had been able to vote in a referendum in 1707, would we ever have joined Great Britain? #indyref

Scotland's #indyref voter turnout is very high for a country with non-compulsory voting. Special vote though.

Stop, stop, he's already dead #indyref

#Dumfries  Galloway result in #IndyRef:Yes: 36,614 (34.3%)No: 70,039 (65.7%)Dumfries  Galloway votes No

Let's all live in a country that rejects it's own independence,use of foodbanks will increase and bankers get richer. laughingstock.#IndyRef

Incredible consistency so far in each area compared with our model of what Yes needed - falling short in each by similar amount #indyref

East Dunbartonshire votes No by 48,218 votes to 30,624. 91% turnout! #indyref

Some massive sways for the No Campaign coming in quick succession.   Great news.  The Union looks as if it lives to fight on! #indyref

We're roughly halfway through #IndyRef results. Everyone get up from their chairs and do a quick stretch

50% of the councils declared 2 wins for Yes, 14 Wins for No. No sitting at 56% #indyref

Woohoo, go east ren :) so happy we nailed the no vote by such a margin! Going back to sleep, hope I wake up to the same country! #indyref

The yes campaign being taken apart like Mel Gibson at the end of braveheart #indyref

I feel sick and just came quite close to throwing up. So maybe my head supports no but my stomach supports yes. #indyref

#Aberdeen should have been much closer if Yes side is to carry the night. #indyref #Scotland

It's OK for me if Scotland is going to stay in the Union but it's better if they will be independent :( =) #indyref #VoteYes

Friend watching #BBCScotland is getting results earlier than we are in England. Hadn't realised there was a time difference. ;) #indyref

Can we have referendums more often please, makes being awake half the night much more interesting #indyref #babies

Glasgow result is quickly becoming immaterial #indyref

Handsome No wins coming in thick and fast now! #indyref

Another trio of NO votes, including a big one in particular from Aberdeen #IndyRef

No now in the lead by almost 150,000 votes, 12.5% #indyref

Seems the grass isn't always greener! Getting awkward now #indyref

Very proud to of worked with thank you for everything. #indyref

Wearing my lucky socks today #indyref

Figured with high turnout the result would be more decisive than polls suggested. Had no idea which way though. Clear now it seems. #IndyRef

So at the halfway mark, it's looking a bit dire for the Yes campaign. But Glasgow and Edinburgh are still to come. #indyref

In honor of the probable Scotland #indyref no, one of my favorite things UK: The Shipping Forecast

50% of council areas have declared. Momentum looks like it's with No (56% nationally) #indyref

No is apparently some 15,000 behind Yes in Alt Clut at the moment. #indyref #Glasgow

Glencoe Highland Park Midlothian Inverness Dundee Lincolnshire Bannockburn Ingleside Kenilworth thx #Scots for #chicago suburbs #indyref

Turnout highest in NO victory areas. Truly a sleeping giant. #indyref

Half way through the #indyref  looks like it's going to be a no win

Big sad face. Best hope now is that North Lanarkshire and Glasgow close the gap and put pressure on Cameron. #IndyRef

Fifteenth #indyref declaration: Dumfries and Galloway says #No (66% No; 34% Yes)

#Eastdunbartonshire NO 61% YES 39% turnout 91% 79011 votes in total Well Done East Dunbartonshire #indyref #ScotDecides

Looks like a no vote I really need to go to bed #workin3hours #indyref

E. Dunbartonshire and Aberdeen both voting NO. Current scoreboard: 44.5% Yes, 55.5% No, 17/32 councils reporting. #indyref #ScotDecides

#bettertogether goes from strength to strength as common sense prevails over Salmond's egotistical fantasies #indyref

I think the main downside to this is that Westminster will think they can keep getting away with the status quo. #Indyref #ScotlandDecides

Big win for the No Campaign in Aberdeen.It's going to be a long night for the Yes campaign. #indyref

Ahh on the diet of irn bru buck fast and deep fried mars bars none of this generation will vote in the next independence referendum #indyref

Aberdeen, East Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire all say No. Looking harder and harder for the Yeses to pull this off. #indyref

Trending towards a rejection of independance that will do me fine #indyref

As larger population centers come in, No is maintaining its lead. The largest more leftist (Yes prone) areas still yet to report. #indyref

Strathclyde University looks like a hell on earth #IndyRef

In awe at the voter turnout rates in the Scotland referendum #indyref #ScotlandDecides

We had the chance to run our own country and we bottled it. I'm so disappointed and so confused. I can't believe this has happened #indyref

Aberdeen City says #NOTHANKS to independence58.61% : NO41.39 : YES #bettertogether #UnitedKingdom #indyref

Seems to be a clear win now for the No vote #indyref

In most countries, people risk their lives and fight to the bone for independence. Here? We throw it away. #indyref #Scotland

Makes me wonder if we'd had even a fraction of the media backing us..would we have won? We had the answers - they had the Media. #indyref

Ah I long to hear more results, but sadly too old for all-nighters these days. Even for you #Scotland. #indyref

I will only have internet for the next 20 mins so let's just say it's a yes and be done please Scotland #indyref #armenia

I have seen an inordinately high number of North Carolina comments on #ScotlandDecides and #indyref, it's not just Scotland!

Scotland, bought and sold for English gold - again! Hang your heads in shame! #indyref

What's going on right now with Scotland's independence is so exciting! #indyref #independence #change

Still got my fingers crossed, but these latest results are looking good for a UNITED Kingdom #indyref #scotdecides #StrongerTogether

Half of the counts in and there's a 130,000 lead for NO to #scottishindependence . The next counts in are going to be crucial #indyref

We're half-way through now. Anyone still awake? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#ScotlandDecides #indyref Results so far 55.5%-44.5% for the No side, with maybe 28% of the votes in. Waiting for Glasgow and Edinburgh.

#seabiscuit is on the move but nobody knows where. Someone check the Erskine Bridge. #indyref

Ebb  flow of #indyref remarkable to see in Glasgow. Yes campaign reticent at first, then plucky - confident, even. Now despondent #indyref

E Renfrewshire and E Dunbartonshire resounding no - was that expected? #indyref

#Scotland #indyref 14thDumfries87% turnouty 36,614 n 70,039busier than one arm paperhanger in a hurricane

In 15/20 years when my unborn kids ask me what I voted in this referendum, i'll broaden my chest and proudly tell them I voted Yes. #indyref

East Dunbartonshire vote NO in #indyref with 91 percent turnout. 61 percent voted against breaking apart the United Kingdom.

Tommy Sheridan speaking wise words about fear campaign by better together #indyref

I love all you No voters #ScotDecides #indyref

Thinking about simple majority for #indyref - obv close race, UK wldnt have allowed it  SNP wldnt have asked if they didn't think theyd win

Had a sleep. The result I was expecting but not the scale. #indyref

Douglas Alexander looking calm and relaxed in Glasgow #indyref

I think Glasgow and South Lanarkshire will be a yes, but it's gonna be tough to come back from this now #indyref

I could cry with utter frustration #indyref #ScotlandDecides #letdown

Well it turned out all the yes voters turned up and voted no! #indyref

But isn't it great.? Watching a democracy in action? A great sleeping giant. Like watching God in action #indyref

#indyref East Renfrewshire lady announcing result slipped  a lovely message of  thanks in too.  #imontellymom #loveyou

this isn't a party political decision Martin Scottish people taking the right decision for their jobs and family. #indyref

Dr Rob Johns, at the STV studio, has just said he would call this for 'No'. #indyref

150,000 vote lead by the No-side. To the referendum, not to me having another pint. #indyref

Result no. 16, a big one.Aberdeen 58.6% No.About 143,400 votes.#indyref #ScotlandDecides

So impressed seeing these high turnouts for #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref is best twitter since the world cup

could we get electoral college situation where no wins popular vote but SNP wins more constituencies?   #indyref

Glaswegian definitely a top-10 proper name. #indyref

All these Scottish accents on my TV right now just make me want to watch #Trainspotting again. #indyref

wow, though it #Aberdeen would've been YES for sure, but not surprised by #Dundee. #Scotland #IndyRef

4:40am, half of Scotland has decided..  It's not looking good for the yes side of things #indyref

To be fair to him though he's got a point, last couple of weeks the British Establishment have scared don't knows into voting No #indyref

#indyref poor Joanna, Alex should be there facing this.

Stirling REALLY surprised me and has completely defeated by thesis for my #indyref research.

Scots vote against independence in four small constituencies:  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

turnout is great advert for Scottish democracy #indyref

If nothing else, tonight is a victory for the F5 key #indyref

This is not the massive, enthusiastic, happy #Yes campaign I've known for 2 years..and the No win halls are strangely quiet too. #indyref

No will win, this is all about the margin. How much of a mandate can Salmond claim? #indyref

Watching skynews so I dont give the convict sheridan any time on my screen #indyref

While I'm in bed, sleeping not happening. It shall be a very easy day of sight seeing tomorrow. #indyref

Imagine being one of these numpties who wrote their name on the ballot paper. #IndyRef

Looking like #Scotland will remain part of #GreatBritain  Yes campaign needs a miracle. #indyref

Not convinced Yes wins Glasgow, but they will narrow the gap there, I think. #indyref

don't why u are getting criticism this great viewing #skynews is the best #indyref #ScotlandDecides

30 mins ago, the difference was less than 1%. Now it's closer to 10%. Glasgow could change it all again #indyref #staycalm

Imagine voting no to your independence. Fucking Tibet, Palestine and other countries/territories would have loved the opportunity. #indyref

the entire thing  the turnout is immensely moving - but it must be a new citizenship for all of us. #indyref

Andy Murray is not an up-and-coming political consultant. #indyref

People should get this excited about politics all the time. Not as confrontational as it has been, but definitely as excited. #indyref

A huge victory needed in #Glasgow for there to be any chance of victory for the #yesvote campaign! The last half hour has been mad!#indyref

Scotland #indyref: NO leads 56% to 44% with 17 out of 32 councils declared - but less than a third of the vote counted.

Wow. Crazy to think a country is deciding not to be completely free for themselves. #indyref

East Dunbartonshire - Yes 38.8% - change on 2011 SNP % vote 0.0 - results at  #indyref

Dumfries  Galloway leaving Scotland?? or english tanks allready? #indyref : No votes 70,039, Yes 36,614 -

Votes are being countedwill Scotland be independent in the morning? #indyref

In coming days Westminster will have to think about tackling the huge problem of over 1 million people rejecting its rule. #indyref

Glasgow may be declaring in next 10 minutes. That'll pretty much nail it #indyref

Can we hold once Glasgow declares? Fingers crossed #indyref

So it really does look like a win for a bullying establishment that frightened people scared of being hit in the wallet. #indyref

The BBC's coverage is so delightfully low-tech. Think they're using same graphics as David Dimbleby in 1979. #indyref #noholograms

Very impressed with voter turnout in Scotland. #indyref

better than a WINO Welsh in name only #indyref

Glasgow to vote yes according to Sky.  #indyref

Never heard of before #IndyRef but mightily impressed.  Smart and persuasive.

If Glasgow vote No, Yes voters will be pretty much no longer standing. Just a matter of time I guess #indyref

I desperately need to sleep as it's 4:40 am but I'm still gripped by the results coming in for the Scottish #indyref #scottishindependence

It's not looking so good for Scottish independence #indyref

What's everyone watching? BBC 1 or stv? #indyref #ScotDecides

Forgot about my tea and it's gone cold. This would never have happened in an independent Scotland. #indyref

What I mean is that #indyref could spell the beginning of the end for minority-backed government under first-past-the-post in the UK.

National Service Bill only for Eng + Wales at moment.  By time it incl. Scotland and service overseas, next war will prob be over. #indyref

if we're adult enough to decide our fate, surely we can take the result of #DemocracyInAction #indyref #chillipower

Scotland will be a much better off now than the rest of the UK proportionately ahead #indyref overall a good night for democracy turn out

No, companies should not be telling their workers if they don't vote one way, they lose their job. #IndyRef

I love how quickly the ISIS/Ukraine/Ebola experts turned themselves into #Scotland experts #indyref

Well done to  for pulling us back! #indyref #thanktheGord #BetterTogether #ScotlandDecides

Watching #indyref and mentally calculating the result as soon as they read one set of votes. Channeling the inner asian politico.

wtf are these Labourites on? How does subordinating ourselves to Westminster help with any of these issues? #indyref  #lazy

If the #No's are overall still comfortably ahead after the #Glasgow declaration, then I think it's all over for the #YES camp #IndyRef

Even in British Columbia's Okanagan valley, we're closely watching the Scottish vote #indyref

not anymore, the #indyref results are looking pretty clear now! #nothanks #bettertogether #ScotlandDecides

#indyref Seems Scottish  votes NO to UK split. Thats positive cc

Glasgow #indyref soon. very close. As I said earlier a bit academic as Edinburgh 60% No will more than cancel out

Looks like a resounding NO in Scotland. Status Quo for another 307 years. #indyref

Tommy mad that people were given information to base their vote on #indyref

Good lord, could do w/o the news summaries #BBC #indyref

This scotch I'm drinking isn't working #INDYREF #YES #Celtic

Sky's coverage of some of the smaller counts has been shocking. I think they filmed them on their early 2000s mobile phones #indyref

Just got to pray mate, we need a miracle #YesScotland  #indyref

The Scots believed George Osborne GEORGE FUCKING OSBORNE terrified them shitless FFS what is wrong with these people #indyref

Tommy Sheridan on BBC Scotland talking utter nonsense. The British Empire is to blame for the Scots no votes so far apparently #indyref

Need to try fit in some sleep #indyref

if you're not reading live #indyref coverage in a heavy Scottish brogue, you're not living life to the fullest

I am please we won't have to extradite Andy Coulson #indyref

Living in Indianapolis aka Indy, seeing #indyref is really throwing me off. I'm thinking it should be #ScotvsBrit

Lots of Nats bemoaning Westminster's attempts to influence voters. Because, of course, Salmond never tried to influence anyone. #indyref

A lesson for all here. First time voter aged 70. #useYourVote #indyref

The high turnout (nearly 90% so far) means a big #Yes to a democratic Scotland. #indyref

Looks like we've lost this.Killing myself now #indyref #indyrefallnighter #ScotlandDecides #VoteYesScotland

Deputy First Minister awaits #Glasgow result #indyref

Yes thank you North Lanarkshire #indyref

labour should hang the heads in shame is that realy what you think a decormatic vote is all about fear and lies, fear and lies #indyref

Glasgow to declare in 10~ mins- watch this space #indyref

This is a bit like watching a one sided football match, need a big Yes vote in Glasgow to keep this interesting - my bed is calling #indyref

585 rejected ballots out of the 700,000+ counted so far? Not shabby. Sad people made effort to vote, but it's a no-count. #IndyRef

C'mon Glasgow, yer beauty. 10-mins till they declare. Would be gutted if my favourite Scottish city were a yes! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Bow down  to you're Imperial Masters he said .and they did #indyref

The 'West' was always my favourite Dunbartonshire. #indyref

#indyref will be interesting to see the Glasgow results resounding NO so far for the declared councils

North Lanarkshire has voted for Yes by 115,783 votes to 110,922. #indyref

Narrow Yes win in North Lanarkshire, but a defeat in South Lanarkshire. Bleurgh. #indyref

why are the BBC giving a platform Tommy Sheridan a convicted liar #voteyes #indyref

North Lanarkshire - woo - not so much - hoo #indyref

North Lanarkshire (south of Glasgow) votes YES: 115,783 against 110,922 for NO.  51.07% - 48.93%. #scotlanddecides #indyref

North Lanarkshire defying its own name  #indyref

North Lanarkshire becomes third area to vote Yes in #indyref

North Lanarkshire supports independence - 51% Yes #indyref

as it stands a gap is starting to emerge between no n yes with no in the lead..#indyref

#indyref turnout 88.2 per cent, 63,516 votes cast.

The whole point of a campaign is to persuade voters. They were just doing their jobs. #indyref

And North Lanarkshire tips barely Yes. The gap shrinks a bit as we await Glasgow #indyref

Karl Rove says Ohio could still deliver a win. #indyref MT Scotland vote update: 17 of 32 councils declared, NO leads 56% to 44%

My cousins apparently vote YES in North Lanarkshire. #indyref #Gray

Very funny CNN #AberdeenAngus This ain't no burger referendum! #indyref

Well done to council I grew up in, South Lanarkshire, voting NO #indyref

I've always said I preferred North Lanarkshire #indyref

Dozing in and out of listening to 'Scotland Decides' on the radio. Hard to keep track of what results from I'm dreaming and not! #Indyref

Said I'd not watch the election results. Woken up and felt compelled to. It's too important. Although won't last the night #indyref

Lots of no's so far Not what I expected #democraticrepublicofsalmond #indyref

Amazing turnout in the #ScotlandDecides vote. But still, count faster, Scotland. #indyref

Spending my day off in New Zealand making lamb curry and following #IndyRef on Missing me mam. #PsuedoJock. #GoStrong.

I'm not even Scottish and i'm on the edge of my seat #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#IndyRef astonishing. Insomniacs, recommend #BBCRadio4 via Web browser, coverage of vote count. #Scotland let 1617 yr-olds vote!

North Lanarkshire just voted YES for #indyref 51-49%. Per  YES needed 52% to hit 50% nationwide.

It's cold and wet and we're waiting for Salmond at the Yes party. Here's our latest, with No ahead so far  #indyref

#Glasgow and North Lanarkshire has voted Yes for independence. Total at 45% Yes, 55% No. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

But the folks in the North voted yes. Interesting. #indyref

#indyref I find it extraordinary that the majority are happy with our country being run the way it is, in all honesty, Scotland has shat it

#indyref seems to matter to most Scottish, but can the fate of the country by decided by 51%-49% result in a single referendum??

A rare win for YES in North Lanarkshire, but 51-49% margin makes only a minor dent into the huge NO lead. #indyref

Anything that Tommy Sheridan supports should be enthusiastically opposed by anyone with a brain. #indyref

North Lanarkshire put 5k in the #yes pile. Perth adds k to #no  #indyref

Obviously the people have heavily been influenced to vote no but who knows what really would have been better.. not me #indyref

I don't know if we'll catch up, Not giving up #indyref

Waiting for the Glasgow result then going to bed #indyref

Chained to my twitters for #indyref. All y'all English owe the Scots a big hug after this.

North Lanarkshire constitutes 6.3% of overall result51.1% Yes 48.9 NoYes expected #indyref

I haven't seen anything about the returns from Dunny on the Wold. The Adder Party had no position that I can recall. #indyref

Some of these places in Scotland sound made up. What is a Dunbartonshire anyway? #indyref

Perth and Kinross: Yes - 41475 No - 62 714No carry Perth#indyref

To me tonight isn't about independance, it's about giving people a choice to decide their future #indyref

FYI, the last time the US saw a turnout of over 70%? 1900! We haven't broken 63% percent since the late 60s. #indyref  #VotesMakeHistory

Refreshing three tabs for news about a vote in a country I've never been to. Actual democracy: what a concept. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

'Yes' from North and 'No' from South Lanarkshire. 20 councils declared, 12 still to announce. #indyref #Scotland

Unless Glasgow is a devastating win for Yes, and the Edinburgh vote is surprisingly close, this is over #indyref

I'm fucking ashamed to be from this country thats full of spineless, cowardly submissive slaves. Fuck this country. Fuck it all #indyref

North Lanarkshire is the 3rd Yes constituency with South Lanarkshire going No #indyref

A 5,000 vote gain in N Lanarkshire is not really with cheering about from the YES camp is it? #indyref

Well, it was a small Margin so don't worry too much. South Lanarkshire pulled it back. :) #ScotlandDecides #indyref

So the No vote now stands at 55% while Yes is at 45%. That's a pretty big margin. #ntfm #indyref

Much thanks to #ScotlandDecides giving us an election night buzz in September over here in the former colonies. #indyref

Awake in America, heart in Scotland! Never thought I would see this in my lifetime. #indyref

The results are really coming in now. Good one from Perth  Kinross #indyref

I wish I lived in Scotland. Exciting day. Voter turnout is astounding. I'm so impressed and wish the US would vote like that. #indyref

Perth and Kinross: Turnout - 86.9%; Yes - 41,475 (40%); No - 62,714 (60%); another big loss for the Yes camp, and SNP stronghold #indyref

#wherewasjustin In the same plane somewhere in Europe with Alex Salmond #indyref

Perth  Kinross Yes 41,475 (39.8%)No 62,714 (60.2%)Turnout 86.9%The Noes have it! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Worth considering that one reason for the high turnout in Scotland could be knowing their vote would count wherever they live #indyref

#indyref Yes:No ratio remains about the same, but margin of votes widens #RefTV

Looks like Scotland will remain part of the UK. #BetterTogether #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#indyref #Ecosse Perth vote NON, still waiting for Glasgow soon

This is a rout for No. SNP were supremely confident in public. All we saw was Yes support. But No really were the silent majority #indyref

#indyref #scotlanddecides Better together talking a lot now about how 'Scotland is divided' - tacit acceptance that this is done

As the night progresses its slowly becoming clear that No may be moving towards victory. Yes 45% - No 55%#indyref

what the fuck is going on here theres got to be something up with these votes solid yes going to no but we are winning in labour #indyref

Turkeys and Christmas are the two words springing to mindoh and heartbreak :( #indyref

Should so work in politics I love this well done Scotland!! Turn out incredible. #indyref

According to Sky, Yes majority in Glasgow is about 20,000 votes - that doesn't sound nearly enough to me. #indyref #NoThanks #BetterTogether

A country's politics divided by urban/suburban/rural? You don't say! #indyref

Watching #indyref from states and I'm exhausted! Can't imagine how everyone at home is managing to stay up!

Total running vote in Scotland #indyref is now 45% yes and 55% no.  Glasgow will likely push yes up  Edinburgh will likely push Yes down.

Lesson from #indyref = What we need for huge Dem/DFL voter turn-out is a GOP threat to take their red states  secede. #mnDFL

Council of Perth  Kinross has voted #NO in the #indyref.Yes: 41,475No: 62,714That's just over 60% to the #novote.#ScotlandDecides

But the ~ 90% turnout is a beautiful thing to see, no matter who has the upper hand. #indyref

#indyref fun fact: the English still don't have an English parliament. Just loads of child raping illegal immigrants.

Hi hipster dude with turban and sunglasses. #indyref

#indyref - am going out on a limb here but congratulations to the union jocks - the big yin

Glad to listen to the voice of NO from the Scottish people, even if it's as a high as the YES campaign. Turnout is astonishing! #IndyRef

Still here folks! Glasgow result right now #indyref

Apparently the answer to the West Lothian question is 'No' #indyref

Fascinating. Looks like it will be Better Together! Scottish Referendum result #indyref

After 20/32 counts NO THANKS leads 55.33% (965,790) to YES 44.67% (779,689) #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Watching #indyref on BBC Scotland. On the edge of my seat. #Glasgow please VoteNo

Current margin: 55% 'No', 45% 'Yes'. #Glasgow could be decisive. #IndyRef #Scotland

Well done Glasgow. Maybe you should be the capital after all! #indyref

RAWR!!!! Can I tag this as #indyref? LOL

People really do make Glasgow!! #indyref #YesScotland #Glasgow

Glasgow #indyref result - Total - 364,664, Turnout - 75%, Yes - 194,739, No - 169,347

#indyref results Glasgow voted and George Black announced the big one. 364 664 votes counted. 75% turnout and it's a Yes.

Nerve wracking watching from the other side of the world but loving the fact that my home voted YES. Go N lanarkshire #indyref #ScotDecides

Interesting results from #Scotland. Seems like economic implications may have pushed more people towards no. Anyone have insight? #indyref

We're getting close. I'll take a 51/49 No win, hopefully its wider though. Looking good for now. Long way to go #VoteNo #IndyRef

Well done Glasgow. Nowhere near enough though. #indyref

And to Glasgow, where great-grandma was born. YES wins there. #Scotland #indyref

the irony is #scotland came out in droves to vote in favor of voter apathy #indyref . Next vote will be 40% and hopelessness

53.49% of Glasgow votes YES but it's not enough. Scotland will remain part of the UK. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Interesting trend that the councils that voted yes so far have the highest population densities. #indyref

Glasgow says yes #indyref But why only 75% turnout?

Glascow votes YES. Yes: 194,779 | No: 169,347. 21/32 reporting. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I'm counting 965,000 No votes and 780,000 Yes.  That's 54% no to 46% Yes.  #indyref

Correction: Two thirds of councils reporting. Half of the votes cast. #indyref

Not enough, Glasgow. That's it all over. Where were the 25%? #indyref

Glasgow voted yes.. Kinda expected that one #indyref

Tonight, I am a weegie not a scot #indyref

GLASGOW I LOVE YOU SO, SO MUCH. #indyref

Glasgow result - Yes victory with 53%. Probably not enough to turn the election around for the Yes campaign. #indyref

Listening to while I wait for the results. #indyref

Glasgow: Yes- 194,739, No- 169,347. That's not enough to swing it to yes overall. #indyref

Both #Yes and #No seem to be in massive denial of one simple fact: we don't actually know what happens next, regardless of outcome #indyref

After 21/32 counts the NO #scottishindependence still leads with 55.3% ! Over 1,000,000 votes now for NO #indyref

GLASGOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YA FUCKING WEE DANCER!!!!! #indyref

Glasgow unsurprisingly votes #yes but not by that whopping majority needed, it's in the bag people #indyref

And would you look. Glasgow does vote Yes. A welcome boost, eh? #indyref

Well done to Yes in winning Glasgow. A big achievement on a poor night for the Yes campaign #indyref

I love that 75% seems like a disappointing turnout. #indyref

me thinks it's time to call reconcilliation lawyers coz seems the jury is booting outright divorce in #indyref

Yes win in #Glasgow unlikely to swing #indyref result in favour of independence - but is indicative of deep divisions in #Scotland

Sad to see Glasgow voting in favour of yes. Congratulations to the people of Glasgow for voting though! #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Here goes Glasgow! #indyref 364,664 counted. YES 53% NO 47%

#indyref Both camps now over 1 million votes.

Proud of my city right now #indyref

I'll be calling all my Scottish friends British from now on #indyref

Only a 25,000 vote gain for the YES campaign in Glasgow. Not enough. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

And there we have it. Glasgow have voted to leave Scotland. Well nearly the rest have said no! #indyref

Glasgow - Vote YES - There she blows, tipping the scales back to 53% for the NO vote #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Good stuff Glasgow. But I don't think it's enough to change things. #ScotDecides #IndyRef

Win but rotten vote in Glasgow for yes #indyref

The Yes margin in Glasgow, the largest population in Scotland, of about 25k votes is not nearly enough to overcome the spread. #indyref

Glasgow votes yes, but not by a big enough margin for the #Yes campaign #indyref

Good morning Scotland.  Whatever the exit polls were saying, today is the day.  Hopefully the best decision has been made.#Indyref

All these smug weegies telling me it was going to be a #yesvote . You must live in a fucking weegie bubble.. 75% turnout JOKE #indyref

Glasgow Yes but only 30k. Not nearly enough. It's a No victory now, the question is will the Yes stay above 40%? #indyref

Sky News calling the referendum result for the No campaign. #indyref

WHAT THE FECKIN HELL I leave you ppl alone for a few mins and suddenly looks like #YesScotland is conceding?  #indyref

Glasgow voted yes but on general frame NO has 53.88% #indyref

Not enough to sway it yet, but I know my home is my home #glasgow #indyref

A win for Yes in Glasgow should give Labour politicians something to think about. #indyref

Even Glasgow couldn't save you #plastichighlanders  has gone missing #shithispants #wetwilly #indyref #WheresWally

Glasgow votes yes. Sobering for sure. #indyref

SCOTLAND VOTE NO! they are staying in the united kingdom! now i can go to bed!;) #indyref #ScotlandDecides

It appears I will get to go to bed earlier than 3am, as it was in 1995.#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Glasgow. Our dear green place, city with heart. Always proud to call this home #indyref

BREAKING: West Lothian Votes NO #indyref. NO 55% / YES 45%

Glasgow votes yes but it's not enough #indyref

Am I going to stay up to see how #indyref goes? Will I care this much about the Georgia election in November?

going to sleep content that glasgow at least voted yes #indyref

Boom. Still together, bigger than expected winning margin too. #ScotlandVotesNo #IndyRef

Wow - #Glasgow's turn-out relatively low. I wonder if people were just too aware of how much their votes could swing the country? #indyref

I'm pretty certain Gordon Brown DIDN'T swing this vote, despite what the Labour faithful want to believe. #indyref

Glasgow votes YES by a 25,000 margin. Still not enough. I can only see NO winning surely #indyref #ScotlandDecides.

Yes peaked just a few days too early. Westminster panicked and brought out the big guns, devo+ etc. Not that scots will get it mind #indyref

That's cancelled out the Glasgow vote #indyref

Glasgow Yes victory not big enough for independence, but big enough to leave a nation divided. Post-referendum rebuilding needed. #indyref

If Edinburgh doesn't report in 5 minutes I'm going to bed. #indyref

South Lanarkshire: 85.4% turnout, 100,990 Yes votes (45.3%) to 121,800 No votes (54.7%) #indyref

Although it will be 'No' this will not be the end. Scotland is a country divided on this issue #indyref #ScotlandDecides

would be cool to see the #indyref election results like we saw #fifa scores

Can we just get on with changing things now please? We know the result #indyref

Suffisant? MT Glasgow votes YES in Scotland's #indyref:Yes 194,779 (53.5%)No 169,347 (46.5%)Turnout 75.0%

Scotland, you had one job #indyref #voteyes

Not good enough Glasgow. Looks like 'no' is going to win. #indyref

Areas of are really very solidly No. Latest is #ScottishBorders. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides #BetterTogether

So the United Kingdom stays united. Unless something dramatic and entirely unexpected happens in the last 9 results #indyref

Can we not cut to George Square? #indyref

Good stuff from young voters, a varied bunch (YouTube)  #ScotReferendum #ScotlandDecides #indyref

watching the Scotland referendum with anticipation, will I get one of the greatest bday gifts of all time? #indyref

That must be that. Yes in Glasgow not enough to turn things round #indyref

#indyref is commentator a cheer leader for the yes campaign. Seeing messages in anything. We had vote  No's have it by miles!

Twenty third #indyref declaration: the Borders say #No (67% No; 33% Yes)

It looks like #Scotland may need a JCB to dig a big trench if they want independence. #indyref

are you kidding!? This is the most exciting thing to happen in British politics since the 97 elections. #indyref

So basically we need to get to 1822985. So we need some big wins. Imagine we did it. True underdog story. #hope #indyref

#indyref gutted totally gutted. Handed over to boris and ukip

This is very reminiscent of the 92 GE. It's the silent votes that are the game changers. #indyref

Game over. Glasgow votes yes 53% - 47% no. Nowhere near enough for yes to win. #indyref

#ScotlandVoteEPA #indyref The YES is going to loose the Referendum after Glasgow declaration or at least very unlikely winning

When are we expecting Edinburgh to declare? Have I got time for a nap? #indyref

Orkney and Borders: pretty similar results #indyref

Has Glasgow having the lowest turnout possibly cost Yes? #indyref

Scottish Borders just wipes out Yes' Glasgow win. Must have been a fun 90 seconds for them. #indyref

What do these results say about the nature of political campaigning? Who responds to the more vigorous style? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

just called it! At 04:54, #ScotlandDecides to reject #Independence #IndyRef praise God, we can all sleep easy #BetterTogether

Cracking result in the Borders! Great work from  the team #indyref

Well, Glasgow was probably the last stand.  Surprised that the Yes margin wasn't greater there.  Looks like No has it #indyref

The flaccid #Glasgow result means there is now no chance that #YesScotland can win the #indyref - Its over. #ScotlandDecides

Bah. Feels like 1992 all over again. All over bar the shouting. #indyref

Scottish Borders votes NO and makes up for the loss of Glasgow #indyref

Twitter is the perfect place to see election results coming in. This is gripping #indyref

Think as the results come in of the Scots living in England and elsewhere - who thus had no say #indyref

Very significant Glasgow result with Yes 53.5%. Probably more sig for long term politics of city than #indyref.

NO needs 566,613 remaining votes to win. But the obvious arithmetic favors NO. #indyref

Interested in #indyref results  how it affects NI? Listen out for  Watch out for too.

Glad to see many others up tonight on twitter. Waiting on Jessica waiting up to feed hasn't been so boring as it would have been! #indyref

the most dramatic outcome would have been Scotland voting 'Yes', but then finding out it's pregnant #indyref

#indyref come on Yes people, sure it hurts but on such high turn out you just have to accept No is the democratic choice made.

Archie the #indyref #yes party dog startled by the Glasgow result.

and the irish! Well I was up anyway but I'm still glued to #indyref on my phone!

There's more NOs than Yeses #indyref

#ScottishBorders have voted #NO in the #indyref.Yes: 27,906No: 55,553That's almost 67% to the #novote.#ScotlandDecides #referendum

#Glasgow #VoteYes, but w/ 23/32 declared. It looks like #VoteNo at this stage. #indyref

The BBC have predicted that the No campaign needs 566,613 to win. They have predicted that Yes needs 767,269 to win. #indyref

I have absolutely nothing in common with the miserable sods who voted No because they are personally fine with the status quo.#indyref

No need roughly 566,000 to win. Yes need 767,000 to win. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Was it too soon? Or was it time to lay the foundation for the next 20 years?  #indyref. Another referendum like this is a long way off?

Thainig 88.2% de mhuinntir Earra-Ghaidheal is Bhoid a-mach a' bhotadh/ 88.2% turnout in Argyll and Bute. #indyref

No party in Scotland's independence referendum gets into swing as results come in favouring a No #indyref

Amazing night so far! Holding my breath #indyref

Just under 2/3rds of Scotland #indyref votes counted, and No in lead by just over 8%

Watch as everyone slowly removes the shit blue yes symbol from their pictures  #indyref

Glasgow was a Yes vote-but a thin one. Not looking good at all. #indyref

Amazing that a turnout of 75% in Glasgow is considered low. Incredible engagement from the Scottish electorate #indyref

So proud to be part of the Glasgow Yes vote. History may not be made today, but we hoped. #indyref

Yes take Glasgow in #indyref by 53-47 as Scottish Borders say No. National picture is 44 No/56 Yes

And a mean-spirited, deceitful campaign consigned to the dustbin of history #indyref

23 / 32 Councils Declared in Scotland. At this moment for Yes (1,055,716) No (1,256,372) #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Fun fact for #insidethebeltway folks watching the #indyref: Dundee, Scotland is a sister city to Alexandria, Va.

90% turnout. Jesus. The straight-up popular vote is wonderful. #indyref #Scotland

#Glasgow votes YesYes took 194,779 votes, with 169,347 for No.Source: #ScotlandDecides #ScotlandIndependence #indyref

BBC looks fantastic tonight, but a bit slow? STV already has Nicola Sturgeon on reacting to that Glasgow result. #indyref

The Republic of Glasgow has a nice ring to it. #indyref

I can't fathom this. Temporary struggle and scare tactics defeats long term gain and prosperity. Rejecting your independence, sad. #indyref

#BREAKING: NO VOTE ENDS WEEKS OF SPECULATION ABOUT FUTURE OF SCOTLAND, UK, AND THE WORLD#indyref #ScotlandDecides

#ScotlandDecides may be decided. With such high turnout, in #YesScotland-stronghold Glasgow was markedly lower at 75%. #indyref

A strong Yes for Scotland's biggest city. Scottish Borders votes No by 2 to 1. #indyref #ScotDecides

But we will forever go down in history for the country to be offered independence and shat ourselves #indyref

The UK was always going to survive whatever the result, though in shrunken form if #indyref Yes vote. It is GB that survives with No vote

I said it before, but quit acting like it's a big deal there is a high turn out. People want to vote, but hate politicians! #indyref

Wouldn't say the Glasgow vote was a massive Yes. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

It's not impossible but being realistic it's a no basically #indyref

BBC slipping into cricket terminology to describe the vote, a victory for sports analogies #indyref

Where's Alex Salmond? Too proud to face the music. Sulking in his chopper? #indyref

Why am I watching Kay Burley in Sky - awful as ever! Need to get BBC on #indyref

I am increasingly astonished at the power of the #indyref vote.  #ScotlandDecides

Scotland's #indyref totals after 7 of 32 declarations:Yes 172,426 (49.1%)No 178,811 (50.9%)  via

That's it - No wins #indyref. Less than 50% of votes to go, Yes would need 57% of all remaining votes. Won't happen.

Well done Scotland, voted with the head, not your heart #indyref

Scotland has decided to stay in the United Kingdom.  Hurray!  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

it's not free for them -- they're the ones paying for it! Nothing is free. 'No cost to user at point of use.' #indyref

I want Scotland to leave. Not because I dislike Scots I just want to see what happens #indyref

Breaking news: call the #indyref for NO. Only 2 days after

Up early anaywaybut keeping an eye on Scotland #indyref

The results so far with after 23 of 32 declarations. No is winning with 1.2m votes (54.3%); Yes has so far got 45.7% of the votes. #indyref

Does History teach us a lesson?When will we ever learn.Unity entails Progress!It catapulted Great Britain to world power and glory.#indyref

#indyref Britain is and always will be bigger than ego.  Here's to the next 300 years. #bettertogether

Looks like Scottish Borders have voted no. No figures yet. #indyref #ScotDecides

Astonished how people are willing to throw away their independence #indyref #Scottish #Canadian

I still have a feeling the Highland and Edinburgh polls will weigh in on the yes side #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Glasgow decide/decides SI/YES #EscociaDecide #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Looks like they bottled it at the last minute! #indyref

Looks like it's going to be a no #indyref I hope the momentum for change translates to whole of UK and we get more devolved government.

Looks like Scotland is going to remain part of the U.K. Probably for the best#indyref

It's by no means the end of the story for Scottish independence, but for the time being we will be staying together. #indyref

I told you NOT TO BLOW IT. Jesus. #indyref

Actual embarrassed to live in Scotland right now #indyref

Cue for all geniuses on $TWTR who called #IndyRef down to the percentage point to start congratulating themselves in three.two.one.

I wrote this about why I would have voted Yes:  #indyref

Cousin showing up on the BBC as they announce Glasgow going YES!!! Whatever the turnout great things happening #indyref #theworldiswatching

I wonder what would happen if England held a referendum on whether or not it wants to keep Scotland #IndyRef

interactiveTweet map shows global interest in #Scotland #indyref #BBCNews  #ScotlandDecides

These were supposed to be Independence nachos. Maybe they still will be? #indyref

The NOs have spoken. Long live the Queen! #indyref

Another big cheer at the Better Together party In Glasgow as North Ayrshire votes no. #c4news #indyref

So what happens now to the #SNP ? #indyref A new leader perhaps ?

What do we expect from Aberdeenshire, Highland, Fife  Edinburgh?  #indyref

How is everyone out there doing on this referendum allnighter? My feeling: democracy is winning by a mile. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Will be a massive victory for Scotland to stay united. #indyref #bettertogether

By my very rough calculations, at 90% turnout, Yes would need to win 57% of remaining votes to win. Seem right? #indyref

The rhetoric for supporters on both sides is quite bad #indyref

Very close in North Ayrshire but i expected more from the Yes side #indyref

Dehwel yn kosk / Return to sleep #indyref

#indyref looks like its cereal for breakfast then.

On the home straight, not long to go now! Wondering how #Highland has voted in the #indyref

More like ignorant loudmouthed bragging from sorelosers (#VoteNo and #bettertogether  #letsstaytogether) #indyref

Final poll released when polls closed now looking like a very good call NO 54% YES 46%  #indyref

Glasgow really made a strong showing but not enough i guess #indyref

Well the Union remains! I usually keep a #UnionJack for such an occasion but this will have to do! :) #indyref

The important thing is that the voice of the Scottish people is heard. That said, FUCK!!!!! #indyref

This despite the fact Devo+ one of the big reasons for No win tonight. The comfortable margin will be used as reason not to deliver #indyref

Well done Aberdeen!  It may have been years ago since I lived near there but I'm proud they voted to be #bettertogether #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref NO is still leading with 200,000  NO needs 566,613 votes to win

Yes may not win, but Westminster is gonna have to make good on Devo promises or Scotland's going to vote yes next time. #indyref

When Westminster piss all over us, and they will. YOU no voters did this. Shame on you. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Highlight of my night was early on when I see this madmans shoes #indyref #indryrefshoes

Sounds like a No. Scotland not divorcing just yet. Wait til the kids are in college. #indyref

Perched  pinned wide awake! Stirling 60% NO! Watching Ayrshire results Can't cope. #indyref

So my 54:46 prediction now looking conservative. Could end up 56:44 for No. #indyref

Huw Edwards just called Andrew Marr 'Andy' #bromance #indyref

Yes needs ~720,150 votes to win now. No wins, the Union is safe. #IndyRef

Wrong. B proud that against massive onslaught from media  govt, 45% of Scots rejected fear. #indyref

I wonder if #indyref would signify the end of the surveillance state in Scotland.

- precisely, and it's where the post-match analysis has to begin. Very very strange. #indyref

Currently 5 a.m. in Scotland with 8 regions left for votes to be counted; 54% have voted NO so far #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Andrew Marr - wealthy defending union, 1m ppl voting to leave despite threats #indyref #indyrefpanic

I am so upset. We are now gonna essentially get smacked bottoms from Westminster and get sent to bed with no NHS. #indyref #yeah

We're keeping count. 8 more declarations to go. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Hey Cameron, don't expect Scots to kiss you ass tomorrow. You are a pathetic excuse of a PM just like your supporters. #indyref

Scotland you are highly embarrassing!! Hang your heads in shame! #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence #Scotland #indyref #scotlandvoteyes

Both BBC and Sky have called for a No win. Theoretically Yes can still win. #indyref

No matter how this ends up, it's sad that over a million people in Scotland will be living in a country run the way they don't want #indyref

So are officially calling it for the No side. The Union remains intact. I could nearly go to bed. But I'll not. #indyref.

North Ayrshire votes NO! Complete NO win now seems very, very likely. :D #ScotlandDecides #Scotland #indyref

There better be change after this, 1m+ said no to Westminster. They can't load them onto boats to the new world like centuries past #indyref

'no democracy worth its salt can put its hand in its pockets and walk away', says on the #indyref #ScotlandDecides

the headline stands.Time to switch off, time to get the bubbly out for a very strong pro-union english wife  #indyref

Most of these councils are showing votes that indicate that Scotland is seriously divided as a country #indyref #Scotland

Either way the Scots will be better off as the Devo Max comes into play #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Any chance we can work out a trade of CNN's John King for the BBC-Brit version of John King? #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Looking at the stats for #indyref HOW did 2,262 (and counting) people stuff up answering a YES OR NO question???#wow

i guess Scotland really wants to keep going steady with the British conquerors to their south  #indyref

A lot of people in Washington breathing huge sighs of relief over #Scotland #indyref results.

To any eligible voters who were a no-show I can say only this  #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

exciting times #indyref. Are you relieved by result? I am.

#indyref with a dignified and mature reflection on bad night for Yes She is a huge figure, worthy of great respect

Not too optimistic on Edinburgh n Fife but ye never know #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Going scot free gets a new meaning today #indyref #ScotlandDecides

But then the British power elite will no longer pull the wool over the eyes of the people of England. #indyref #bbcindyref

Poor show for #Glasgow, why only 75% turnout? #indyref

Breaking News: Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- #indyref  #TCOT #p2

The UK's 3rd largest city does not want to be in the UK. This will be ignored tomorrow. Devastating. #indyref

North Ayrshire results for Scottish Independence Referendum  #indyref

Would echo Marr. When you've got more than 1 million people willing to take such a gamble to reject Westminster change is needed. #indyref

I've never seen the BBC look so happy! #indyref

So sieht es aus: How Scotland has voted so far, as #indyref counting continues

Early morning start. Slowest driver in the world. #indyref

George Square, #Glasgow at 5am. They're out but not down. #indyref

A cheery boo goes up from the Better Together HQ as Nicola Sturgeon appears on the TV #indyref

The streets of Edinburgh are sounding much quieter since 'Yes' support has wained.  #indyref #cdnpoli

Not huge win for #Glasgow #yes won it but small gap. #indyref

Well I'm up too early then to find out. I will give it another hour and go back to bed #indyref

I believe the Scots are about making the best decision realistically. its not about emotions, its about facts. d bigger d stronger. #indyref

South Ayrshire declaring a victory for the No campaign. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Scotland the brave has turned into Scotland the English #indyref

#indyref - growing up in '60s, we were taught that Scotland was a country.

Hard to believe No is going to pull it out with this outdated ad campaign. Guess Cameron has to step down. #indyref

Was I the only one who thought that was my alarm going off during the Clackmannanshire declaration? #indyref

claims that the NO campaign is on course to win the #IndyRef election: Scotland will remain in the UK

Signs pointing towards a No vote in the #IndyRef but Scotland remains divided and generally disillusioned with Westminster

So many 'could it happen here' columns being furiously edited and hopefully deleted right now. #indyref

Being told it's not long before we'll know which way Aberdeenshire has voted. #indyref #skyelections

Let's hope for consensus on devolution for Scotland and rUK by 3 main parties. Unity in the union is needed now for reconciliation #IndyRef

Maybe Glasgow should secede from Scotland? #jisssayin #ScotlandDecides #indyref #ScotlandTheBrave #ScottishReferendum

Cheering because you dont believe in your country is just embarassing #indyref

can't say I'm really surprised about #indyref #ScotlandDecides result, people routinely choose stability over freedom #AskAnyLibertarian

South Ayrshire votes NO - One of the final nails in the coffin for independence #indyref

What does a potential no say for the SNP? What is their next move? #indyref

I'm thankful Scots had the freedom 2 have the #indyref; I'm also personally glad the UK has survived. #PrayForScotland #ScottishReformation

So #Scotland remains a part of the #UK Victory for the 'No' campaign. Now for all those promises to be delivered #indyref

LOL that guys reaction! COME OOOOOOOOOOOONN! #SouthAyrshire #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Yes voters jumped the gun a bit in South Ayrshire. #indyref

#indyref #ScotlandDecides Phew! I think Scotland dodged a bullet therenow on to Catalunya!

Wow,  I thought US was dvided country MT How Scotland has voted so far #indyref

well done Labour, fear worked. Interesting to see your positive spin on remaining 60% austerity cuts from 2015. #indyref

Beg for more now jocks! #indyref Ass fucked ourselves! Scots are Tory forever! I luv my county :) #scotsvotetory

The poorest and most deprived in our country were moved to vote, and they voted for a fairer society. So sorry we couldn't do it. #indyref

It's game over, I'm going back to bed! #no #indyref

Come on! Where's the Edinburgh result? I need some sleep. #indyref

It's looking like the silent majority may have it. Nice one Scotland, you know it makes sense.. #indyref

The man on just said the prime minister would be waking up soon-if I was PM of Scotland I would not be sleeping right now. #indyref

#indyref South Ayrshire declaration takes registered voters votes now declared to 70.4%. This is what counts, not number of councils declard

yes. This is going to change the UK constitutional landscape regardless. And not before time. #indyref

So they're not getting Scott-free anytime soon #pun #Scotland #scottishindependence #indyref

The important thing now is to regroup, work together to make Scotland better by making the UK better. #indyref

I actual want to greet the now and just go to sleep :( #indyref

With more people than Scotland  a higher GDP per capita, isn't it time for #DevoMax for London? #IndyRef

We are now told at least half an hour for #Fife's declation. #indyref

Let's hope the #indyref does bring us #bettertogether - it's time for everyone to be compassionate towards everyone else's Politics.

I think that Scotland will still be part of the UK after today's results #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

Because they're the adults in the room? I don't know, I'm #American, I've been fascinated by the process. #indyref

REFERENDUM: Yes campaigners celebrate in Ravenscraig. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Come on Edinburgh you dirty stop out #indyref #COUNTFASTER

Nicola Sturgeon: Not trying to spin my way out but it is absolutely clear that there has been a real demand for change. #indyref

Now is a good time for a divided Scotland to come back together as part of the UK and soldier onward. #indyref

Can't understand how people can celebrate continuing to be ruled by an unfair government. #indyref #heartbroken

Scotland votes yes!on women in the RA #indyref #UnionJack

Aberdeenshire, Fife, and Edinburgh expected very soon. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Perth  Kinross votes NO #Perth  #Kinross = No- 60% Yes- 40% 20/32 declared #scottishindependence #indyref

#indyref how does it give more powers to the south west?

Believing that the British Government has no right in (Scotland), never had any right in (Scotland) and never can have any right in #indyref

because there is a lot of people only care about them not their fellow scots, they don't want to make a difference! #indyref

Watching #IndyRef reminds me of living in Quebec in the '90s

I know!! There's something compelling about watching the result of a vote that people actually care about. #indyref

All the #indyref polls are pretty tight.Says a lot about what the people want, and the true nature of democracy.

No matter what your political leanings, you have to feel sorry for someone who's given so much time to a campaign that's failed #indyref

The final #indyref declaration from Scotland's Chief Counting Officer may come within the hour, reports

Re: last RT. Told you so. #indyref

SHITE! How Scotland has voted so far, as #indyref counting continues

#indyref Glasgow - Scotland's biggest city votes for independence but in democracy total votes matter at the end. collective responsibility

I wasn't making excuses, and maybe you should think before you speak. Wait, #Voteno and #bettertogether don't do that #indyref

Judging by the voting, Maybe Glasgow should have just tried to separate from Scotland  the UK #indyref

(Scotland) the presence in any one generation of (Scotsmen) of even a respectable minority ready to die to affirm that truth, makes #indyref

Bitterly disappointed. Let's see if BT will fulfil their last minute vow/pledge/desperate sweeteners #indyref

Another small example of the #BBC's misrepresentation of the truth. Results are NOT live. My FB friend is announcing them first! #Indyref

that Government for ever a usurpation and a crime against human progress. - James Connolly #indyref

Personally, I think all of the Ayrshire's should reunify because it's enough with all the directions. :) #indyref

Yes campaigner reckons this was fear triumphing over hope. Inclined to agree. #indyref

EAST AYRSHIRE VOTES NONO 44,442YES 39,762#ScotlandDecides #indyref #BBCNews

#indyref if you voted yes you made your own mind up,if you voted no you were brainwashed by 'fear' - what an insult to the voters.

I'm at this morning for #IndyRef outcome. Sterling up more than 1% over past 12 hours; FTSE expected to open up about 1%

. 84262 84.5% Yes 39762 No 44400 (rounded, too much cheering). #indyref

Okay, hate to be an idiot, but what does #indyref mean specifically? You know besides the Scotland independence whatnot. #dumbamerican

Ok, Guardian has fixed the error. Results were flipped. West Lothian wins #No. #indyref #VoteYesScotland #ScotlandDecides

Hardeep Singh Kohli pointing out that nothing will change - there will still be foodbanks and austerity in Scotland. #indyref #miserable

You can tell the East Ayrshire counting officer is a no supporter :P #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Gargantuan #NoThanks is a-looming but regardless of stance, don't be glum - we've an eternal beaut of a country. Tartan hugs to all #IndyRef

Watching the votes come in for #indyref in Dubai, feeling very far away from home - in distance  political view. Hope this works out for us

Scotland has won whatever the outcome #scottishindependence #indyref

East Ayrshire Declaration - no 44442  yes 39762 giving no an extra 5000 votes #indyref

#indyref Indeed, well done Project Fear. you scared your way to victory. now get out and feed the poor so they feel #bettertogether

Reason for rejections, they're a bunch of fannies!#IndyRef

Feel sad for Scotland. I'd out myself and I live in fucking Surrey #indyref

Good to see Nicola Sturgeon chatting to media amid an avalanche of No declarations, Salmond conspicuous by his absence. #indyref

And also 21% in Dundee #indyref RT: Extraordinary that 25% of people Glasgow had something better to do yesterday than vote

OK lets look at this If everyone in EdinburghEvery single oneVoted yes it still wouldnt be enough #indyref

The #YesCampaign ie being exceedingly bitter and calling it fear politics to have won. Incorrect Common Sense has won tonight #indyref

With a No vote almost certain, will we see a substantive UK-wide analysis of the constitutional settlement? #indyref

26th #IndyRef result in from East Ayrshire - 53% No, 47% Yes - more soon at

Looks like the UK is staying intact! Time for bed. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

E Ayrshire, pretty mixed area, votes narrowly No 47-53. No surprise, except for the graphic designer on LSD! #indyref

So I assume England will just go back to treating Scotland like a red-headed stepchild tomorrow. #indyref

I predict a MASSIVE run on coffee tomorrow morning throughout Scotland #indyref

Council 24 - North Ayrshire - returns a 'No' vote. Just eight councils left to declare. #Scotland #indyref

Why bother going to vote if your just gonna be a dick and put an X in both boxes #indyref

How do we get #indyref turnouts in our elections? I have democracy envy. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

Hoped to see a lot more Oasis chat on the #indyref hashtag

54%-46% looking pretty stable right now. #indyref

It looks like the Union Jack will continue to fly as Scotland votes against independence. #indyref

There is a movement of over a million determined people in this country, I hope we can build on everything we've achieved so far #indyref

I might go float a dinghy and declare it an island of my own #indyref

Surprised the turnout in Glasgow (a YES)  wasn't more than 75% #indyref

Well you've blown it Scotland. And for what? A pension? Security? And you get that from the Cameron? Bullshit. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Can't believe I've stayed up all night for this #indyref

East Ayrshire one of the more surprising No majorities #indyref

Wow #Scotland I'm shocked.I thought for sure you'd #VoteYes for #independence. #IndyRef

Let's remember we have voted for this together in an unprecedented turnout. Scotland has listened and it has responded. #indyref

Glad I'll still be able to say Edinburgh is my favourite city in the UK! #indyref

The polls were wrong - not nearly as close as expected!! #indyref #bettertogether

And the wine makes way for coffee. Historic night for Scotland #indyref

East Ayrshire, great stage background#ScotlandDecides #indyref

Looks like despite the despicable Alex Salmonds best effort to destroy it, the United Kingdom will remain intact. #indyref

Exactly- the UK is divided regardless of final result.  #indyref

Having Devo-Max on the ballot would have split the NO Vote. Good gamble by David Cameron. #IndyRef

Good morning. Seems it's all over bar the shouting. #indyref

Come on Edinburgh and Fife! I'm on the edge of my seat here!!! #indyref #nothanks

Hardeep is a twat! Just accept what's happening! #indyref

Altogether now a 1 and a 2 and a 3 is a grade A twat and a smug one at that #indyref

Never thought I'd see the day when I was getting up at 4.30am to catch the politics on the telly !! #indyref

that's it, could never understand why anyone that served with HM Forces would #VoteYes #indyref

At this point I can go to bed knowing when I wake up that the #UK will be #bettertogether #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Awful nights sleep likely with nerves but least woken up so some slightly good news, but it isn't over yet #shattered #nerves #indyref

My Irish time line reads largely like the other woman whose intended ultimately decided to stay with his wife. #indyref

Tough to hear news of #indyref, not the result, I can't understand the Scots!

(One) big question for the next few weeks: how much more devolution will his English MPs allow Cameron to offer? #indyref

So in short well off people and areas vote to stay in uk.  Those who have done less well from it vote to leave #indyref

Just when you thought there wasn't anyone more conceited, arrogant and out-of-touch than Alex Salmond, up pops Hardeep Singh Kohli! #IndyRef

Since it appears to be a night for doomed Scottish causes, here's a good ol' rollicking Jacobite song:  #indyref

Looks like they ain't rebuilding Hadrians wall after all #indyref

I fail to see how that is a negative in the slightest. #indyref

It's clear that Scotland has indeed rejected independence - the voices of the Yes movement cannot be ignored and must be heard #indyref

If you voted no, you've thrown us all under a big red double decker bus. #indyref

I'm going to bed. Such an exciting day. Goodnight Scotland. #indyref

YOUGOV poll from last night looks spot on. #Indyref

I honestly feel that history will prove we were right for what we strived, though I hope now that real change for all can happen! #IndyRef

Regardless of your view on the #indyref result, I suggest you should watch some clips on Youtube

BBC and Sky now forecast that Scotland has rejected independence. #indyref

Looks like the No have it. Not as close as the Quebec referendum. #cdnpoli #indyref

never knew there were so many Ayrshires #indyref

BBC forecasting a No vote. Seems stating the obvious, but also quite significant. #indyref

BREAKING NEWS (5.14am) - Scotland has voted NO and will stay part of the Union (UK). #indyref

It's sad that thinking only ~54% of a population are happy is a great result #indyref

I don't understand how people can vote against their own independence. #indyref

Well the one upside is I won't have to buy a new globe. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Sky News and the BBC have both called #IndyRef for No.

With six more polling stations to declare, Scotland has for the majority voted no and rejected independence #ntfm #indyref

BBC now officially forecasting a No win #IndyRef #BBCIndyRef

It looks like the name of the next royal baby it ll be Scotland #indyref

Last week's Devo sweetener seems to have had the desired effect #indyref. People vote for more of the same from Westminster.

So it looks like #AlexSalmond biggest achievement is a divided #Scotland #timetoheal #indyref

BBC forecasts at 5.14am that Scotland has voted no to independence - huge moment  #indyref

BBC now forecasts that Scotland has rejected independence. I can go to bed knowing our wonderful kingdom is still united #indyref

Gutted. My nation just voted against its independence. Maybe the next generation can find the confidence to stand on their own. #indyref

I hate Labour. Lining up with the Tories to cheer austerity #indyref

Before Mel Gibson sobs away his concession speech, let me just note that the pollsters are really the biggest losers here! #IndyRef

A very depressing night indeed. Amazing turnout  very close #indyref

Imagine voting to be ruled by another country Id say some Scots shit themselves #indyref

Good-looking design from Scotland Decides team: to avoid party colours, they've plumped for fuchsia  teal #indyref

It looks like a done deal for the #nothanks. #Yes campaigned hard - #BeProud. hard work begins now to work for #ScotlandsFuture . #indyref

Game over The worst, see our friends too disappointed, very sad, but convinced that the YES Movement will continue #indyref

Kinda wish I had gone to the Trafford Centre and queued for an iPhone and watched the #indyref results there #regretoftheday #itsonly5am

BBC now forecasting that the no vote has won, too much for the Yes vote to pull it back. Nine results to go. #indyref #indyrefallnighter

BBC forecasting  that #Scotland has voted NO to independence with 26/32 declared. #indyref

Taking off my kilt and putting my pants back on. #indyref is officially dead.

Six results to come. We're awaiting results from:AberdeenshireArgyll and ButeEdinburghFifeHighlandMoray#indyref

Odd of the Beeb to call it for no with a clip from Up Pompeii, but why the hell not. #indyref

Here's hoping everyone from Yes campaign gets into leftwing progressive politics #feminism #socialism #environmentalism #indyref #revolution

I'm sure the SNP will now start talking 'proportional representation' #indyref

Stunned by #indyref so far. Really thought Yes wd win. Huge turnout major boon, but size of Yes vote is a cry for help. We must answer that.

The final result hasn't even been announced and the number of bitter Yes voters is already ridiculous. #indyref

This is a vote for the status quo. This is not for change, no PM has that power when their party doesn't support the bill! #indyref

The people of Scotland have spoken. Now time for the people of the rest of the UK to speak for change in the way we are governed #indyref

Scotland stays, all Yes voters pack your bags and please form an orderly queue as you leave the United Kingdom. #indyref

Proud that Glasgow and West Dunbartonshire have gone for Yes at least! #indyref

Is it wrong that I would rather be with than my wife right now?Sorry babe. #indyref

Scotland Independence vote has been counted. BBC says Scotland will remain part of the UK. Final vote not counted yet. #indyref #Scotland

Looks like the Sweatys have decided the enjoy being our bitches after all.#indyref

Looks like the United Kingdom will stay united   #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Interesting that thinks a 6% Yes win in Glasgow is a good, comfortable win. Low standards it seems! #indyref

And there it is. The BBC calls time on #indyref, declares the 'No' vote the winners.as they have all along

No matter what the outcome, you have changed politics Not only for Scotland but for wales N Ireland and Northern England alike #indyref

yes, twitter wins the night in America for anyone who cares about global news events. US TV networks #fail #indyref

Oh good all my Union Jack souvenirs are still good. #indyref

predicting an overall NO in #Scotland. Thank goodness common sense has prevailed. #BetterTogether #IndyRef

Dundee and Glasgow can have independence if they want. But it'd be independence from a united Scotland. #indyref

One last thing. Sturgeon calling Glasgow a great success. No it wasn't. It was a disappointment for the Yes campaign. #indyref

I'm ashamed of every scot who failed to vote #indyref

Well despite #maxdevo not being an option on the #indyref ballot, I think tonight's results are an indication that's what Scots might want.

Ok so I'd greatly appreciate the true result of this referendum as I'd like to go to sleep. #indyref

Feel like my heart rate finally getting back to normal as declare a no win #indyref thank you to all voters x

Fun fact: both yes and no now have more votes than Lab + Tories Lib Dems in the last Holyrood elections. #indyref

Never thought I'd agree with Tommy Sheridan. #indyref #piginapoke

well done, you can kick back now with your friends at RBS and MS after a scare job well done. #indyref

Asked for #indyref prediction earlier at work, said 55% No, BBC now agrees, wish I'd placed bet. #fb

Lesson learned today: When something matters, the Scots SHOW THE FUCK UP. Americans can only hope to be so patriotic. #indyref #democracy

Westminster leaders wipe sweat from their foreheads in relief but surely must know politics must change #indyref

SCOTLAND SAYS NO. Scotland rejects #indyref with no vote set for victory  #scotlanddecides via

So being American and relatively uninformed, I had no horse in the #indyref race, but must the No tweeps be so fucking smug?

A No vote is a vote for change. Real change is coming. Negative nationalists already discrediting what Labour will deliver. #indyref

Scotland can be proud of the way it has conducted itself, in one of the most convincing democratic processes of my generation. #indyref

So after all that, British Cupcake Fascism wins the day #ScotlandDecides #indyref

After 40 years of moaning and sniping the separatists of the SNP have had their great moment - and lost #indyref #ScotlandDecides

1/2 I'm so proud to be Scottish, but right now i am disappointed with Scotland. I think you've let yourself down. #indyref

I'll be surprised if Alex Salmond survives this vote - so not all bad then#IndyRef

the no camp have sold us down the river obviously with the help of the intelligence services lets look forward to more food banks #indyref

It's over. Scottish voters reject independence but new debate over devolution and regional authority set to begin. #indyref

That was fun.  Never tweeted while running stats so fast.  Didn't have a dog in the fight, so I wish all well.    #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Scotland will vote to stay in the United Kingdom after rejecting independence, the BBC has predicted  #indyref

Not very keen on the language used to report #indyref: 'campaigns' 'winning'; what about 'people' 'choosing'?

Looks like Scotland voted No. Even though no new country will be born tonight, the effects on the UK will stay long after. #indyref

No 220,000 votes ahead. Edinburgh will clinch it. #indyref  #ScotlandDecides  #skynews

4 councils at the very least have to call (assuming 50% 'no' subsequent results) for 'no' win-wonder how long it will take them to #indyref

Well I'm up! They say heading towards no but Edinburgh still to come in. #indyref

#indyref #ScotlandDecides why do I have to see Sturgeon's brave face?

Yes won across all eight Scots Parly constituencies in Glasgow, with 6,000 majorities in two of them #indyref

They didn't get a Wallace style pep-talk: Sky News, Guardian and BBC all say Scotland decides 'No,' rejecting U.K. independence. #indyref

On the plus side are surely goosed as an organisation. What an absolute embarrassment to lose Glasgow #indyref

Looks good for the United Kingdom staying together! Now the politicians need to deliver on more devolution for the whole of the UK #indyref

A very good summary of the #indyref by (even if he hasn't yet mastered the apostrophe):

Britannia rules the waves. Britons never, never shall be slaves #Forza #RuleBritannia #indyref

Interesting to see that many working class people in Scotland vote against their best interests just like they do in the US. #indyref

Sturgeon says she always believed Yes campaign could win. So did most supporters, that's what makes this so tough. #indyref

It may be a No result but it doesn't mean it's a vote for the status quo. Westminster need to make major changes. #indyref

The BBC presenters of #ScotlandDecides seem to be on the verge of openly laughing at Nicola Sturgeon. #indyref

As Scotland nears a decision on #indyref, whether it breaks from the UK could have implications for New Zealand:

Message from #indyref? Apathy is curable, every vote counts.

The default position of the mob on BBC is party politics. Minging patter. Missed the point by miles. #indyref

WSJ:Early signs in #Indyref suggest Scotland likely to stay in U.K.

It's amazing though that this whole process can be done democratically through a vote rather than war for freedom. #Scotland #indyref

The 'No' vote is surging upon news that an independent Scotland would have to iron their own shirt EVERY morning. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

The absolute real winner was always going to be democracy, whether it was yes or no #indyref

Don't worry, the thought of building a better country through independence was always illusory anyway. #indyref

The most difficult thing is going to be bringing Scotland back together after this. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

My fear re #indyref is that ~46% of Scotland proposing to burn the establishment to the ground and walk away will result in nothing.

get tommy Sheridan off my screen! Accept it! Move on and stop trying to downgrade the No vote! #unitedwestand #indyref

Regardless of outcome I'm impressed by #indyref turnout. If only it didn't take something dramatic to get pple to the polls #ScotlandDecides

BBC and Sky News call a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum before dawn breaks  #indyref

Biggest question from #indyref is how long it'll take the Lib Dems to turn the results into dodgy bar charts?

Not sure why the #bbc have decided to poster their no forecast across side of building. #indyref

It looks as if the vote will be ceded, soon. The deputy 1st minister just showed up in the news.  #indyref #Scotland

#bettertogether #scotland #indyref Just because your wife doesn't move out, doesn't mean you don't have to fix the marriage.

Alex Salmond in hiding (presumably drunk) as Scotland rejects his ludicrous secessionist plot. #indyref

already quoted in media outlets that the new powers promised for Scotland will be a lot weaker and will take longer to implement #indyref

My 1 year old has awoke crying, perhaps he's Scottish #indyref

#Scotland had a choice to secede from #Britain no violence just by putting an X in a box think #UnitedStates would do the same? #indyref

Wel, well, well. Not quite as close as we once thought then. #indyref

You had the power to make political decisions in your hands for FIFTEEN hours Scotland, and voted to give it right back! #indyref

#indyref How these people are still talking so much is quite something #ScotlandDecides

Nearly daylight - up all night witnessing the #indyref results - Yay! #citizenselfie

The 500,000 Celtic supporters who travelled to Salzburg are being blamed for Glasgows poor turnout #indyref

Now it's time to fight for Scotland and not each other #indyref #ScotlandDecides

even if it's not the result wanted, the scottish have done themselves proud with such a high turnout #indyref

Whilst I disagree with Nicola Sturgeon's views and policies, I admire her as a politician. #NextLeaderOfSNP? #IndyRef

We now MUST push for major change. If not we have failed ourselves, our children and the deprived areas who clearly want it most. #indyref

Areas of high unemployment or working class correlated w. higher YES vote 4HOPE indicating protest against Tory Austerity  #indyref #cdnpoli

Damn, there go my plans for moving to a tory free country. I think every city and town in the UK needs to do a Pimlico.#indyref

Still think Salmond's dream scenario was a narrow No vote. Huge power to negotiating elbow with very limited downside #indyref

[Y] Raiders of the Lost Ark[meh] Temple of Doom[+1] Last Crusade[meh] Crystal Skull#Indyref

I've not made any #indyref tweets until now. But well done Scotland, you've shown incredible common sense! Looking forward to staying here

So. Anti-climax? Never seemed in doubt once the first result came in. #indyref

Cheers to the UK. Tea and scotch with the missus tonight to commemorate the Kingdom surviving the #indyref

Around about now, I'd usually be finding out how much the Botswanan Pula is worth today. Screw you #indyref.

Dear Scotland, I have a dissertation to write. Please can you hurry up with the result? #thanks #indyref

Sky News predicting a firm rejection of independence, looks to be 45/55 for No  #indyref

I've never liked the guy, but Gordon Brown sure as hell showed the weakness of the current Labour leadership #indyref

The difference between Yes and No vote is exactly 220 125!  Which meansYes : 45,7%No : 54,3% Voters : 2 574 029 million#indyref

More annoyed at the anchor mispronouncing of Edinburgh then the BBC commentary on the vote. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

We had a great opportunity and have completely bottled it! #Scotland #indyref

The sun rises and it's a new dawn. Not the #indyref - but #MatLeaveMuz means that will not be at work for approximately 284 days

DECLARATION: The People Of Scotland have said 'Rule Britannia' - #ScotlandSaysNo #indyref #followVB #RTID #WATP -

Always room for another leftish party to emerge from newly energised Scotland however! #indyref

somewhat conveniently I woke up at 5am and I don't have to go out until like 11 so now I can see the results #indyref

I wonder how the Lock Ness Monster voted in Scotland's #indyref

As much as people are happy with a no vote, it must count as something that over 45% of the country so far are unhappy like this #indyref

I'm not looking forward to work today. I wonder who will take down all the Yes banners? That'll be a depressing job. #indyref

I love you Scotland and I hope you don't let them keep you down. Keep on fighting and demanding a change!#ScotlandDecides #indyref

Todays #IndyRef is tomorrows #EURef. You think this one was divisive and dirty? You ain't seen nothing yet. #ScotlandDecides #Indyref

Scotland #indyref is over. It was exciting. I am relieved to see the collective wisdom rejected separation. Congrats to all

If you think about it the YES campaign still got a result, they got what they wanted which was more powers to Scotland #indyref

We could never be a country if we tried ! Get real my mongo pals:) #indyref

Ahh well Scotland can just vote the Torries out in May . Ohh no wait. #indyref

There's been a major boost for the yes campaign in the Scottish independence referendum - Glasgow has voted in favour of breakaway.#indyref

Now the Yes campaign is blaming the BBC, British mediasaying it's the erosion of democracymaybe it wasyou. #indyref

Cheer up Indy fans - at least Piers Morgan is leaving the UK!  #indyref

Nearly 2000-year-old Jewish text Pirkei Avot (3:2) predicts #indyref:

#indyref both Britain and Scotland will emerge stronger together after this

Devolution to an English parliament not sufficent. England would be still too centalised for 52 million people. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Sasha Baron Cohen is back on the bbc. Doing this bc he lost the gig playing Freddie Mercury. #indyref

Proud of my city, disappointed in my country!  #indyref

Pretty thrilling to watch #indyref from the vantage point of a former colony. (My heart said Yes, but my mind said No.)

So we're not going to get a bewildered review of what might have gone wrong with the vibrant and vitalised #Yes campaign? #indyref

Looks as though the UK will stay intact. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

I'd like to save us from British oppression and the yoke of the monarchy but I gotta make lunch for my kids and clean the kitchen. #indyref

#indyref live blog team at 1 Southwark Bridge, 5:30am

Mwahaha oh I'm being so very negative. I just want us to be better, and the status quo didn't look so good really. But let's see. #indyref

I thought the Scots would take their fate in both hands  run to glorious FREEDOM,but maybe that's the difference to Donbass ! #indyref

Heads up anyone who thought a No vote wouldn't lead to a less tumultuous fallout is in for a shock. #indyref

No claims victory! What did they win?  #indyref

Right. Time for a cup of tea and a wee cry. #indyref

This fag packet thing. Even if it was true (and it's not, proposals were out months ago), shouldn't we be looking at the MESSAGE? #indyref

Don't worry guys, the YES voters are going to try again as soon as the find out how to resurrect William Wallace. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

wouldn't blame him for doing so! Is going to need a lot of energy for the coming weeks #indyref

Delighted for Scottish Borders  Dumfries and Galloway #bettertogether - you've done us proud - #indyref

My Icelandic wife (Iceland pop. 300,000 and no oil) just woke up to find Scotland voted no. Beyond comprehension. #indyrefpoll #indyref

3/4 let the #indyref post-referendum commentary begin: what will happen now, all the broken hearts, Salmond's future/fate, devo-max etc

Yes you did so well deeply disappointed, we have let down our young people #indyref

Scotland I weep for todaybut live another day to fight another battle #indyref #VoteYes #GE2015

So Scotland will remain part of the UK. Here's hoping they'll remain Better Together. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

When I wake up, I'll be ready to push hard for more powers - it won't happen quickly - but we need to get it right (2/2) #indyref

There will be some disappointed people in Scotland today but delighted that they will remain part of the UK family #indyref

Eyes won't stay open. It's been fascinating and exciting, #IndyRef! Good night, #BetterTogether! #UK

Pleased that #Scotland is still part of Great Britain and the #UK. #Indyref,

Hardeep Singh Kohli is a VERY unhappy camper. #indyref

In terms of real votes, the NO margin in Dumfries  Galloway was LARGER than the YES margin in Glasgow. #indyref

Dick Stiffe and Willy Johnson, seriously, I can't take much more of this. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Cats couldn't quite stay up for the final results from #indyref

Want to rule a country? Nae it sounds like too much effort, cant someone else do it? #indyref

After the 1707 union, Scotland had an amazing burst of creativity - the Scottish Enlightenment. Do it again!. #indyref #bettertogether

Loving Tommy Sheridan on the BBC right now. Perhaps he should have been the face of this campaign. Speaking absolute sense. #IndyRef

fear greed and lies with a dash of corruption win the day our children will never forgivewe are condemned, history will show all #indyref

Sorry.. had to run to the chemist.. ok.. I am ready to get this #indyref back on track!!!!

#indyref Scotland decided not to be fooled by Alex Salmond. Carnage averted.

#Scotland needs to change, 46% can't be wrong, give people water  they will drink it, give people a voice and they will speak #indyref

Rigged? Scotland Rejects Independence, NO Vote Set for Victory! #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref Bend over Scotland, here it comes.

Hey, I'm a white, middle class male - the system loves me. Just thought it'd be nice to give others a try. #indyref

Let hope Alistair Darling plucks his eyebrows in celebration. *Hairy oobits #indyref

#indyref result begs the question: are bookies better pollsters than pollsters?

When are they announcing these last six areas? I'm knackered! Salmond not on until 10am :( #indyref #scotland #northernireland

From what I hear, and if it;s truthful, thank you Scotland. Thank you #indyref

The YES campaign offered hope and opportunity - #indyref

Whatever the result, Scotland has shown us that every vote does indeed count #indyref

#indyref NO camp have won us more food banks and more austerity. You won the battle but lost the war.

While Scots got the chance to vote, Americans can only dream  #indyref

What should join John Reid for? Not what he wants. He wants to stitch YES Scotland up. We have a different agenda. #indyref

Hong Kong's only Scottish pub is a mad house. Referendum results on every TV. Reporters everywhere fouling each other's shots. #indyref

No matter camp, Scots gave the world an example of facing great political change  differences without violence! Bravo  Thank you. #indyref

at least this gives plenty of opportunities to keep talking about the barnett formula #indyref

I'm American. If I'm watching BBC News, I don't want to hear American news. xD Go back to talking about #indyref

Looks as if our little island is staying together in one piece for the time being #indyref

Fear. It was fear that did it. #indyref Now we wait for the empy promise box to open and a laughing clown pop out.

#indyref I Bet the oil companies are creaming themselves over this.How about a national run  owned Co? Crazy eh, oh, wait BP! until Thatch!

It's not over - there is work to do - to honour the pledge - trust would deliver it in full #indyref

Thanks for backing us to be puppets for another 100+ yrs, where a child's aspiration is a minimum wage job at best #indyref

Nicola Sturgeon can now get out of her red dress #indyref #scotlanddecides

We bought a bottle of Lagavulin tonight, so at the very least Scotland made a sale #indyref #scotland

Looking forward to referendum breakfast this morning with and #indyref #Belfast

At the main #indyref count in Ingliston. Waiting for the inevitable announcement of a NO vote victory

I'm sooo freaking tired by now. Could they please hurry up with counting remaining 6  councils so I can catch a bit more of sleep ? #IndyRef

Sowe are a nation no more, merely a bad joke.at least I can look myself in the eye and know I did the right thing. #indyref

Accidentally stayed up all night. Incidentally, reading #indyref results as they come. Getting caught up in politics again. Help!

Absolutely heartbroken, we just rejected our own independence and decided to stick with the status quo. We only had one chance. #indyref

Goodnight world. Thanks for watching us and supporting us, no matter who you were pulling for #IndyRef

Anyone one know of research on regional affiliation in the UK? #indyref

Fuck this shit. I'm starting my own independent state out the back garden. Cards on the table though, I've got no oil. #indyref

I hugely believe in social media  communication but this taught us that there'll always be a silent majority that we can't forget #indyref

Waiting until the last vote is counted before I say anything. Don't want a repeat of the Gore v. Bush election night shenanigans #indyref

Arrived at what's now called the 'No Party.' Celebration among activists, relief among MPs. #indyref #scotdecides

it's called democracy whether you like it or not. More of your fellow country men ( and women ) disagree with you. #indyref

Let me just create a third option. #indyref

The takeaway: Independence isn't for everybody. Poor buggers. #IndyRef

Need my bed but I've lasted this long I am not giving up. #indyref

You're only chance and you say no ?! You'll live with the regret forever #YesScotland #indyref #

#indyref I have some rapeseed and olive oil if that helps

Wonderful news from the UNITED Kingdom! I think they will need some community conciliation and cohesion after this!  #indyref

Scotland, we tried. This fight will bring change regardless. Let's continue to make sure that we get what is best for us. #indyref

The number of ppl who came out to vote is astonishing against any country's voting percentage.. be proud of that #indyref

To Edinburgh, Fife, Highland, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Argyll  Bute: Come on guys, what's taking so long? #indyref

Get In!!! So glad we stayed together :)  Better Together Indeed! #indyref

The scene at the Yes party in Edinburgh where (we think) Salmond due to speak soon. Atmosphere flat. #indyref

Sky News declares no side has won yet. #ScottishReferendum #indyref

Of course Aberdeenshire could still turn out to NOT be a Tory reactionary shithole and vote resoundingly YES (hahahaha) #indyref

UGH! RT: I've spoken to Alistair Darling - and congratulated him on an well-fought campaign. #indyref

Widely varying turnout in Glasgow constituencies for #indyref - 80% in Cathcart, 68.7% in Kelvin

Not much sleep. Been following #indyref on twitter. Getting very exciting now!

#indyref THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK! Scotland votes for a United Kingdom. Great news.

Global tweets From Angola to Zambia: Interactive map of #indyref tweets

lol the lifespan of David Cameron's promises/bribes to Scots can now be measured in hours #indyref

and at least 2,300 Scots (probably 3,000 total) just spoilt their ballots! #shameful #indyref

GB seems to have saved the UK. #indyref

Are ppl honking bc #indyref results? That's so nerdy, Ottawa. (The kind of nerdy only a fellow nerd could love.)

Oh ffs now I have to see chuffed tories. #indyref

There's only 26/32 declared, Why are people saying it's a no? #indyref

We need to take this result and move forward as the UK! If huge problems arise then this issue should come back, we cant just regret#indyref

Now Scotland, if you'll just go back below downstairs and prepare England's breakfast please. #indyref #downtonabbey

Well, looks like Scotland is staying with us bastards for the foreseeable, yay! #indyref #indyrefallnighter #ScotlandDecides #bettertogether

NO votes can't be just down to the undecideds. Those saying they'd vote Yes clearly haven't. Change of heart? Or pretending before? #indyref

Interesting to see that Glasgow, Scotland's biggest city, voted yes. #indyref

The fun around #indyref almost makes me wish Six Californias had made it to the ballot.

Hopping off of Twitter. It's been an entertaining, informative night - and disappointing, but not for the reasons you may think. #indyref

Regardless of your voting stance I can't fathom how a 'Scottish' person can cheer rejecting their own independance???!!! #Indyref

I'm not angry at my country. I'm disappointed with my country.To me that feeling is much worse! #IndyRef

No time for congratulating yourselves.  A time to take a good hard look at yourselves  mend your foul greedy ways #indyref

Patronising by John Reid is a great way to pour petrol on troubled waters. #indyref

CNBC:Scotland's #indyref: BBC has predicted a win for the NO campaign with 54% of the vote.

Come 7am this #edp24 will hit the news stands. #indyref #history

The pound is soaring for now. But what happens if the Unionist parties can't deliver on their promises of extra devolution? #indyref

#indyref Leading Tory politicians already discussing rebelling on Gordon Brown's #bettertogether campaign promises.Scots you have been duped

Has ANY country ever rejected it's own independence? #Scotland #indyref

(Really going to bed but must note the other remarkable #indyref thing - the folks are only now starting to look tired. Hats off!)

~27.1% of #indyref registered voters votes still to be declared from 18.8% of the councils #councilsizesvarywildly!

Can the no campaign even celebrate? Is being too scared to grasp a once in a lifetime opportunity something to celebrate? #indyref

Trapped nerve's kept me awake since 3am. Followed the voters thro the early hours tho. Exciting. I'm glad we're sticking together. #indyref

led to believe 5m eligible to vote #indyref yet most results in far less than 3m am I missing something here

Westminster will need to realise this vote is a No to independence, not a Yes to Cameron, Milliband and Clegg. Time to deliver #indyref

Been up since 4 watching the #indyref Waiting for last 6 results, then going back to bed!

I could understand if he was relevant, but he's lost it. #indyref was his meal ticket back to relevance. #blew #it

I have to disagree with my friend who finds it odd that quite a few Americans formed strong feelings on #indyref.

Firestone Union Jack pale ale (Paso Robles, CA) Only seems fair given tonight's #indyref result

A generation destroyed by Thatcher, votes to stick with a Tory govt. Well done auld yins. #indyref

Arthur Midwinter on the subject of devo max:  #indyref

yesterday they were easy to identify as they entered the polling stations,heads bowed and ashamed. #indyref

I'm surprised Nicola Sturgeon hasn't said 'we didn't lose, we came second' #scotlandstays #indyref

Hearing the word 'federalism' spoken by politicians who are not Lib Dems is really exciting #indyref

Thai colleague thinks #BetterTogether sounds like an adorable sitcom about old people. #indyref

The 'No' campaign appears to be closing in on victory - Results and reaction on our live #indyref blog here:

Happy that negotiations can now start for a fairer Britain while keeping our crucially important union intact! Good news for the UK #indyref

Ah well it didn't come off in the end. Still great to see the democratic will of the people. #indyref

#Scotland: Votes No! :) The #UK remains intact. Let's drink to that Scotch preferably #indyref

Scots vote No. The beauty of this is, it is the Scottish People who determined whether they stay together or go apart. #IndyRef

86% turnout is truly incredible  heartwarming to see. Well done Scotland. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Times are changing This is not good Glascow, Scotland's biggest city, voted: Yes 53.4% (194779) No 46% (169 347) #indyref

What now? Hard to be optimistic this morning. #indyref

while English votes for English MPs will be a constitutionally messy, wouldn't it? #indyref

Turnout of just 69% in Glasgow Kelvin. Absolutely baffling. #indyref #ScotDecides

Salmond should resign not because he has lost, but to allow Scotland and the United Kingdom to heal. #indyref #BetterTogether

Devestated. However I can hold my head up. Scotland the brave? Fuck that cowards and traitors. We wont heal this. #indyref #devestated

has a great council-by-council breakdown of the #indyref votes:  #ScotlandDecides #ScottishReferendum

When I hear Nicola Sturgeon talking about 'delivering change' I wonder how different she really is to the average Westminster type. #indyref

Curious what happened in the #indyref by constituency? Check out map //

It hurts today, but much exists that can be built on. So much of #indyref was sound and fully democratic it will not be lost

Alex Salmond not appearing all night, and not speaking until 10am says it all really. If his vote area says No then he has failed. #indyref

It's certainly not a victory! One step forward and two steps back! #indyref

The BBC are talking like it's done and dusted. It's not over until all the votes are counted. #indyref

#indyref so to westminster: you brought this union to the brink of dissolution.  Pull your socks up, you've got a lot of work to do.

Dafuq is taking the last six counts so long? #indyref

PM David Cameron to make an address on #indyref at 7am GMT. #ScotlandDecides

Not a single no voter can complain about welfare cuts or austerity, or about paying billions out of pocket to fund useless WMD. #indyref

#indyref it's looking prob no, but what if Edinburg is yes!? My rough calc in head says not much in it if Fife n Edinburgh go yes by enuff

Then I remember: the BBC is pretty much all that the UK has, right? And then I wonder if maybe I'm not so off? #indyref

Westminster is about to mess us over us from a great hight #indyref #VoteYesScotland

Sad to hear predicted outcome this morning, but well done to every Scot who voted. Amazing turnout! #indyref

Right. Time to get up! Oh. Wait. #allnighter #indyref

Important to note that Glasgow was awash with the Yes campaign, so super unsurprising about the vote there #indyref

over to you Mr Cameron. justice and fairness honesty integrity a moral compass for our UK nation not politics. #indyref

I agree, Scotland now needs to move forward. Another #indyref campaign in the next 15 yrs would be damaging.

#indyref Scotland stays part of the UK. Good night, Panama.

It looks like the questions the yes campaign couldn't answer are deciding #indyref

#indyref Auld Lang Syne - The Real Mackenzies:

It's not his fault I suppose that so many Scots love WMD,austerity,liars,broken pledges #etc #indyref

Good morning Scotland. Good morning Great Britain. God, the a Queen will be relieved. It is a No. #indyref

I'm very sorry to see the the outcome is almost certainly No. The Yes campaign got a lot of people to sit up an take notice. #indyref

Looking like a No vote in Scotland, but let's hope she's all the better for the democratic debate. Scotland we love you #indyref

#indyref polls seem to agree w votes, fingers crossed this means motivated pressure from 50% of Scotland to get promised powers delivered

Watching my fellow countrymen fist-pumping their Dependence victory is probably the most ashamed I have ever been to be Scottish. #indyref

Please world, don't be too hard on us. This hurts. #indyref

#Indyref one thing's clear. If you're not living in the midst of this, you can't know what it's really been like. London media take note.

Phew. That was close #indyref (and i win my bet with my mum)

Can hold our heads high for standing up for the country we love and wanting the best for ourselves!! we have done Scotland proud #indyref

I'm our gyms!Who's she kidden lol #bbw#indyref

So, Wales. you wanna piece of us now? #indyref

I suppose this means we can continue being the UK Chamber of Shipping! #indyref

Didn't think I'd get as emotionally involved as this. Astounded by the amount of faith people seem to still have in Westminster #indyref

Rallying call here 'Paisley will we fight again.' Resounding clap but in reality that chance has passed in this generation #indyref

I still think #indyref is an incredible piece of history to be fair, regardless of the outcome

Apart from the result, most impressed with high turnout. Proper democracy at work #indyref

A possible NO victory but I wouldn't put it down to the efforts of a negative NO campaign.   #indyref

in some areas I think you're right. But for many people it's been  okay; an opportunity for discussion #indyref

UKIP have pushed Cameron to the right. Lets hope Scotland have just pushed him back left #indyref

Gutted that people let FEAR conquer HOPE #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Did you also ring to congratulate and thank and ? #indyref

With such a massive unprecedented turnout of voting,no side can moan now that the result isn't indicative of what the country wants #indyref

I honestly don't know why, but the NO vote has disappointed me. #indyref

Salmond's dream shattered as Scotland votes to stay in the United Kingdom  #indyref

Thank you, Scotland, for not condemning the rest of us to a thousand years of salad and Tory rule. Very much appreciated. #indyref

Peter Hain: The big unanswered question for British politics now is what we do for the English regions #indyref

System parties are now going to use the #indyref No result as method of further weakening not only Westminster but the State as such.#bbcdp

Looks like a good result for the Tories rather than Labour, which was not expected! #indyref

Yes voters have no monopoly on caring, nor patriotism. They just think they do. #indyref

Absolutely buzzing, no way I'll can get to sleep. I'll crash and burn later #HappyAsLarry #indyref

Just woken up. Feel a bit emotional - fantastic that Scotland decided to #VoteNo in #indyref

I'd be more inclined to be thanking bet that's something that will never happen. #indyref

I'm almost drunk enough to start tweeting about #indyref. Almost

Not a ton of recognition in #indyref No for Gordon Brown parachuted in last minute for a flagging No campaign:

This political nerd would like to thank Scotland for the reminder of how amazing democracy can be. #indyref

Kinda bummed that the #Scotland #indyref has been called by the BBC for the NO side. Time for some uisge beatha.

They drank a Scotch, they took a piss and everything stays as it is. #ScotlandDecides #Indyref

So sad and disappointed that we weren't in the end brave enough to grasp the thistle Grassroots engagement must now build momentum #indyref

thanks for this opportunity shame others didn't realise what we can achieve without the union #indyref

This level of political engagement is the envy of the UK. The Union demands change, Scotland shows it can happen #indyref #ScotlandDecides

So the big  question now is how to devolve powers to Scotland, but also to Wales, Northern Ireland and *crucially* to England #indyref

The Lords could be abolished altogether and made into the English Parliament with the Commons the British Parliament. #indyref

westminster is already lining up to fuck scotland. the big 3 sold us out!!! #indyref

let alone all the whataboutery from the so-called left! Labour must surely be totally delegitimised in the eyes of Scots #indyref

Sod Twitter! Just put Bovril on me toast instead of Marmite #indyref

#indyref Nicola Sturgeon looks so tired tonight, why is she conceding defeat and not Alex Salmond?

Just to clarify Salmond - the majority of Scotland voted NO - we did not vote 'Deferred Yes'.  NO Salmond, we voted NO!  #indyref

People on BBC talking about Cameron delivering positive, radical change to politics have obviously been up too long. Delusional. #indyref

Nicola Sturgeon has conceded the referendum. #indyref

The first signs of Alex Salmond are starting to come out Not taken it well. #indyref

you still up? You're missing all the #indyref banter #onlyjoking #youmissednothing

Let's honour Salmond's own request- that the sovereign will of the Scottish people should be respected. #indyref

It is all about well-organised campaign, BBC won #indyref. #ScotlandDecides  to reject #independence. Alas

Thousands unable to vote cuz they stood in the wrong line. The iPhone line. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

The Independent  2mSalmond has changed his Facebook background to this   #indyref

you sir, truly are kickass. The anti-venom to democratic poision #OneScotland #indyref

Before I delete Twitter an facebook, I think it's time we got the people's voice heard an got into scot gov #indyref

A little disappointed i have to admit. Lets hope we can all work together to build a better future. #indyref #scotdecides

It's always the tweet with the typo that gets all the retweets, isn't it #indyref #longnight

Chattering classes down south are already deciding what is best for Scotland. We need a strong voice to represent us up here.   #indyref

It's a point made on Twitter but massive turnouts BUT no voter turned away or hanging chad-style stories. Well done #localgov. #indyref.

Wonder how long before there is a RAF air strike in the Middle East.. Now the #indyref is over. #cynic

#indyref So the revolt was quelled, in these times that means you still get to shape your destiny, however you could have architected it

bollocks. #indyref is a sign of dissatisfaction at the status quo.

Patrick Harvie now totally blaming the SNP. Not his fault. Nope. Nothing to do with him. #indyref

Seems to me what's really happened is the UK has rejected the unitary government system. Will federalism take hold in Britain? #indyref

Love this from a FB friend. #IndyRef supplies

Now that Alex Salmond has lost he deserves the same treatment as anybody else for committing treason. Off with his head  #indyref

Can't say I'm not disappointed at #indyref results, but incredibly impressed that the entire process was carried out with respect  maturity

David Cameron has congratulated Alistair Darling on a well-fought campaign #indyref

So close. Fells like a penalty shoot-out. A re-match will be demanded. #indyref

England has most of the power because we have most of the voters. That will always be true. #ScotlandDecides #Indyref

Looks like I'll be throwing away my design suggestions for the new Union Jack. #indyref

And if BBC is to be believed, the Noes have it. #ScotlandDecides #indyref. Dont suppose the demand for 'free' #Scotland ends though!

At 7 am, I need to get a bath, to get to church for 8. Hurry up and declare, you 6 slowcoaches! #indyref #indyrefallnighter

Nick Clegg is expected to speak later in Scotland and the PM to make a statement outside Number 10 at midday. They better be good. #indyref

Wonder what Mel Gibson is thinking right now. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

The team at debating today's historic front page #indyref

I'm surprised at how close the #indyref is -   (honestly) I expected the Scots to go for independence . . .

Most entertaining part of the night was the bloke giving the results in Gaelic. Give him his own show.  #indyref

Is this the man who saved the Union? Gordon Brown #indyref #ScotlandDecides  What do YOU think?

Can we have a referendum on the House of Lords? #indyref

Going to sleep proud to be part of the 46% who stood up for change and chose hope over fear, we really fucking tried. #indyref

I feel strangely disappointed at predicted outcome of #indyref   I don't want business as usual for UK. No more #ConDemNation

MT An extraordinary night. Humbled by the level of support and the efforts of our volunteers. #indyref

Ok Scots.   Here is an idea from the Colonies. Count the ballots at the polling place. Phone those results to the Centre #indyref #faster

An Independent Scotland is now and always has been only just a dream #indyref

Glad to see the power of democracy (still).  #BetterTogether #ProUnion #indyref

#bbc, #indyref. #itv, #indyref. #ch4, #dealornodeal  Genius planning by Channel 4. Couldn't Deal' do a special  for the Scottish Election?

And sent him homewards to piss himself laughing, drink claret and smoke a cigar. Career politicians won over street politicians #indyref

The guests change but Huw doesn't. The poor sleepy man #indyref

Scotland has spoken. Return to normal life-Bitch about Westminster, Biased BBC, London media control  English favoritism. #indyref #ublewit

Congratulations to Labour in the Scottish Islands Western Isles 53% No 47% Yes. #indyref

Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has conceded that the No side has won the referendum, reporting #indyref

Aberdeenshire declaration just got cut off by BBC Scotland to make way for Edinburgh. #indyref

If you need someone to break down these results DM me #indyref

We wait like an hour, and get two areas at once. #indyref

Unlucky Scotland, hopefully we can all break away from disgraceful Tory politics together one day #indyref

Can't wait to see the demographic data on the voting #indyref Cc

Gotta turn on Russia's state TV this morning. Have they begun insinuating vote rigging yet? #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

You know, with the results mostly in, my heart feels sad but my mind is glad. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

#indyref Glasgow Yes vote is people NEEDING change. SNP needs to meet these with current powers  deliver original manifesto promises.

Scotland: I wanted Yes, but it seems to be No. I'm sad. I wish US voting turnout was as impressive. Scotland = inspiring! #indyref #voteyes

I love you #Edinburgh to let #No votes lead. Thank you. #Scotland #indyref

Scotland is on course remain a BIGGER part of the UK after #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

I'm rather pleased with the result. I get to keep my house and my family keep their jobs. Thank you #bettertogether #indyref

Peter Hain MP is spot on. Scotland have spoken for the whole of the UK, we need a Federal UK solution.#indyref

The vote in Scotland should be decided in the next hour! #indyref

such a disappointment in our own capital city #indyref

You had ONE JOB, Scotland.  *shakes head*  #indyref

Independence hasn't happened it seems but change must. I think that's something every Scot wanted for their future. POSTIVE CHANGE! #indyref

Scotland's #indyref turnout, esp. young adults, has been exceptional.  Just fantastic.  Hope that level of engagement continues!

#Edinburgh result in #IndyRef:Votes counted 319,025 (84.4% turnout)Yes: 123,927 (38.9%)No: 194,638 (61.09%)#Edinburgh votes No

Resistance is futile. You have been assimilated into the British collective.#Scotland #indyref

Edinburgh is no longer my capital. Disgusting! #indyref

The 'No' campaign has won a majority in the Scottish capital Edinburgh #indyref

It would be kind of nice to have the full results of #indyref as opposed to simply the predictions. #ScotlandDecides

Whatever your position on #indyref, got to admit that British democracy works fantastically well. Warms a European's heart.

Four regions left to declare;Fife,Argyll and Bute,Moray,The Highlands#indyref

Edinburgh, my birthplace, says NO. Thank you Scotland for voting yes to unity #backfromthebrink #indyref

Time to rest, reflect, recalibrate. The roots of the UK have been shaken. The kingdom of God cannot be shaken. Hebrews 12:28,29 #indyref

Sincerely hope that out of this comes much cleaner, fairer, more logical separation between regional  central power in the UK. #indyref

No now v v close to getting over the line. #indyref

Scotland may not have gained independence but the voters have also sent a clear message that change is needed #indyref

Haven't been up all night, as it's afternoon in NZ, but have been keeping up with the #indyref results  feeling quite glad it looks like No

Nah I've had enough of this farce. Shameful display. #indyref

I wonder what will happen to that little toad Salmond when this is all over.  I'm betting he won't be jumping away any time soon #indyref

Where i grew up (Argyll and Bute) was a no as well. Let's see what Fife do #indyref

Fuck sake. Looks like Biff, Chip and Kipper are gonna have to publish a fucking 'How to write an X in a box' book. #indyref

I'm so impatient, can't bare this any longer actually feel sick#indyref

Scotland has spoken and from a happy Englishman I'd like to say well done, we are still united as one #WeAreFamily #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Edinburgh votes no by a huge margin. Might have seen it coming if you looked past the signs, buttons, etc. that where everywhere. #indyref

Such a shame that the Scots couldn't do the right thing and take their arrogant self importance and fuck off with it #indyref

Looks like #Scotland's sticking with the rest of us, but #Dundee?! You renegades #indyref

I guess they had to decide what side of the bread is buttered #indyref

Hefty NO votes from Aberdeen and Edinburgh. No surprises there #indyref

careful some might view this as scare mongering #VoteNo #bettertogether #indyref

Your resignation please, Mr Salmond.  Only interested in hyping up people with crazy promises and a fantasy White Paper. #indyref #Scotland

Glasgow #bettertogether campaign rocking as #Edinburgh declares Nothe place to be this morning. #indyref

#ArgyllAndBute result in #IndyRef:Yes: 26,324 (41.48%)No: 37,143 (58.52%)Argyll  Bute votes No

#indyref Rejected by your own constituents and the electorate.  Resign.

Alex Salmond?  Nationalist protester restrained by security at Better Together party #indyref

Aberdeenshire joins the city in voting No - by 108,606 voted to 71,337. #indyref

Its a fix, a conspiracy I blame the scaremongering.Laughable.Andy Murray would say Game Set and Match.#indyref

My home town Edinburgh says No to independence: Yes 123,927 (39%), No 194,637 (61%) #indyref

BBC still refusing to FORMALLY say the No vote has won. Which is presumably when they say it in a dinner jacket. #indyref

I trust will order EVERY council in the WHOLE of the UK to fly the Union Flag at full mast, loud  proud today! #indyref

Thank you, Scotland, for an exemplary display of democracy. We applaud you - and hope others will be inspired by your precedent! #indyref

To all those who bet against the pound: you lost. #indyref Be a big day in the City.

This is really awesome, never thought I'd see that happen with the  Scotland. #indyref

#VoteNo need 85,122 to win now, its been obvious for a while - but every vote should be counted after a huge turnout from #scotland #indyref

Thank you #Scotland for not opening Pandora's box of nationalism and seperatism in #Europe ! #indyref

So so excited for Scotland's future #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Aye or Naw, Scotland has shouted so loud it's made Westminster tremble. That's a #win either way #indyref

Amazing thunder and lightning seems to be commenting on the #indyref

Unbelievably ashamed. To call us brave scots now is an embarrassment and a lie. The lack of hope in our nation is depressing. #indyref

It's Gordon wot won it ! #indyref for #Scotland Yay :D

Looks like a big fat NO in Scotland then!#indyref

So pleased it's a #Naw. Massive congratulations to everyone involved in the #BetterTogether campaign. #IndyRef

Confidence in UK gov at an all time low #indyref #timeforchange #poorshow #getyourfingerout #ScotDecides

Nice to see Edinburgh voting to stay! #wishiwasthere #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I must admit, I thought #indyref would be closer than it's turned out to be. But that's why we love politics. Always trust #thepeople

Scotland has REJECTED independence - tune into for full analysis #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Good news in BC! With #BCTF teachers voted Yes  to school AND #Scotland says No to Independence remains UK #indyref Schools opens Monday!

yeah but its not the same, Scotland is already a country. We already had a turn with breakaway, didn't go so well for us #indyref

TV3 catalunya - 2nd last for the night. #indyref

As a Scots-Irish American, I couldn't be more disappointed in the #indyref results. Too risky to decide your own future? #YesYouCouldHave

Watching results on CNN in hotel room makes you appreciate BBC and SKY coverage #indyref

3 councils remain. Fife has lots of votes to count; Highland is very physically big. Morayjust futzing around? #indyref

ARGYLL  BUTE VOTES NONO 37,143YES 26,324#ScotlandDecides #indyref #BBCNews

EDINBURGH VOTES NO: No real surprise here. #indyref

Maximum sads. Oh, well, it was a lot to ask. Now, if you'll excuse me I have to watch some Stargate Atlantis. (wipes away tear)  #indyref

I know all we get is even more of your money that nice man Mr Cameron promised us - thank you #indyref

So  has praised on a on 'well-fought campaign' as #Scotland votes no in #indyref:

Tbf has been left to deal with this herself. Salmond has done nothing to help #indyref

Onus now on Westminster to swiftly deliver on enhanced devolution pledges - could take a while to work though detail though. #indyref

Come on  WE ARE SOOOOO CLOSE Big Wins for us in Edinburgh and Aberdeen#indyref  #VoteNoScotland

Wow, Edinburgh votes No by HUGE margin 61-39%. Thats a massive defaeat for the Yes campaign #indyref

#indyref What's that I hear? Is it a soprano warbling in the wings?

Edinburgh votes NO (61.1%) and Aberdeenshire votes NO (60.4%) 4 Scotland independence #indyref - congratulations

Cycling home as the sun comes up after a night of watching the #IndyRef results. Very happy haggis

Oh well it seems Westminster won the #Indyref

Edinburgh Declaration - no 194638 yes 123927 giving no nearly 71000 more votes #indyref

Never in my life would I think that I would  say that I'm ashamed to be scottish #indyref

Both Salmond and Darling to give speeches soon. We will be back in a few hours with reactions and the latest developments #indyref

Impressed - doing a superb job of holding together the BBC's #indyref coverage.

Well done Scotland, sanity prevails! #indyref

However, the voting turnout has been significantly high which bodes well for the general election hopefully.#indyref

I am a bit glad tho. I didn't want to break the union- but for a chance at real change yes was the only way. So. Tough decision. #indyref

That concludes our #indyrefallnighter coverage from Edinburgh. Good night/morning and good luck! #indyref #ScotDecides

As a 'No' supporter I hope that the government honours its pledges to Scotland and puts the wheels in motion for change. #indyref

to be honest you NEED BALLS to run a country. and ask for independence. THe scottish didn't had that ! . #indyref

Some very shameful Facebook statuses going on #manup #indyref

Well done Scotland. You choose . . . Wisely. #indyref

Glad to see I won't be needing my passport to come and see you again #indyref

84% turnout in #indyref Highest turnout in Scottish history breaking 1951 record

William Wallace wouldn't have been too happy about this #indyref

Just wait till Boris get elected ! Thatcher wie Baws ! #indyref

Oh and it Gordon's constituency to seal it.  And the BBC fancies sticking with it for a bit while they all celebrate together. #indyref

#indyref Scotland have at least shown us that are NOT a party of the UK!

I wonder if Wee Eck and the SNP will now refund the costs of the  #indyref

hmm results almost exactly how the BBC predicted, it's almost like they knew the result beforehand #VoteRigged #indyref #ScotlandDecides

In the end nothing changes: Murray is British when he loses and Scottish when he wins. And the other way around. ;-) #indyref

Worth staying up for! Glad the NO voters won #noindependence #indyref

Fife, where ex-PM Gordon Brown hails from, may be where Better Together/No goes over the top. Only needs 85,112 to win. #IndyRef

I'm welling up right now.. So proud of Scotland. We've seen through assertions without substantiation. #ScotDecides #indyref #NoThanks

What about these? On the No table but look further and they're marked as yes. ? #indyref #voteyes #VoteYesScotland

Anyone else see #IndyRef trending and imagine Harrison Ford with a whistle?

I'm so used to the chaos in Mexico that I'm in awe with how the situation is being handled #indyref

Loved your film explaining the #INDYREF to foreigners. Thanks.

The whole #indyref process has highlighted how crap all of our Party leaders are. White, rich, public schoolboys to a man.

A battle for the good is not win in just one vote This has to be a continuous push to victory, even if it takes another generation #indyref

the media knew who had won by 10pm last night, you could just tell #indyref #fb

As always, my heart is in Scotland. Both sides fought well and the respect between them was commendable. #indyref

Three results left to come in.. Scotland has REJECTED independence #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Good morning if you're just up, hello again if you're still up? #indyref is all very exciting isn't it? #studentsvote

I'm so glad Scotland has had the right2decide its future.As an international socialist,I'm so glad the decision is2stand together #indyref

How about some independence, eh? #ScotlandDecides #indyref #SayYesScotland

Gordon Brown has to emerge as one of the clear winners of the night. #indyref #Scotland

Been interesting seeing everything unfold. Very calm and respectable. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

This morning I'm a very happy Englishman and proud Brit. Welcome back Scotland. We won't let you down. #indyref

Edinburgh votes NO in Scotland's #indyref:Yes 123,927 (38.9%)No 194,638 (61.1%)Turnout 84.4% VIA

Home after an incredible 24 hours reporting on the #indyref for A momentous occasion I will never forget. Bedtime now.

#Indyref now the biggest choice we have to make is which of these #cunts we choose to shit on our country next.

I think you'll find the outcome of #indyref supersedes your opinions of Gordon Brown.

Scotland has dreamed a dream it is now up to the UK to deliver. #indyref

For sale: Open-Top bus. Dark blue with white stripes. Buyer must collect from Edinburgh. Unwanted present. #indyref

Woke up to find i still have to go to work, with all the Fear in the #indyref i was expecting a giant #Moat  to have been built overnight

I wanted a draw, extra time and penalty shoot out. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Did you hear excitement when someone put a pile of Yes votes on a No table prior to dividing them to count? #indyref

Edinburgh says no and with that I'm heading to bed. #indyref

Oh good it looks like Scotland is still with us and hasn't drifted off into the North Sea overnight #indyref

What a night to be working in the STV newsroom. #indyref

Good morning everyone - still counting in the Scottish Independence Referendum, but the No win is imminent #indyref

Very happy to be waking up in an unbroken United Kingdom. #indyref

Please don't tell me we're all winners. Winners don't weep quietly on their sofas at 6am. #indyref

If Fife No vote goes above 70% then it's a huge sign of Browns effect on the overall vote. #indyref

#Melbourne voted Republic in 1999, #Glasgow in 2014. Therefore good music scenes blossom where the monarchy is rejected. #indyref #auspol

New day so let's look to the future #indyref #ScotDecides

My favorite (crime) novelist, has hinted his next Rebus book will unfold against the backdrop of the #indyref. Now he can begin.

#indyref  I'm shocked! I really thought the #yes vote would take-it, a chance to get rid-of the #BullingdonBoysClub .

would rather see Cameron gloat than Salmond..Salmonds face is already punchable.just imagine how smug he would of been #indyref

May have to rethink tonight's dinner plans, it'll be straight home from work to bed for me #indyref #tired

I'm more embarrassed than anything. The whole world just watched us bottle it. #indyref

Tonight's #Indyref coverage by me was sponsored by MI5

Not sure I'm allowed an opinion being a Canadian of English heritage, but I've been watching the #indyref results all evening.

The Winner today is Democracy ( #indyref ) , British Politics is changed forever make no mistake of that. All Voters Yes or No want change!

Campaign for Glaswegian independence! God I love my city so much. Final proof that I've found my home. #indyref

The question is will this whet the appetite for change  do the yessers have the fortitude to see this through in 10/20 years time? #indyref

#indyref SCOTTISH WOMEN are the strongest factor in keeping UK together. They act as MOTHERS of the nation. pls highlight their role!

Commiserations  positive feelings to every good Yes voter out there, I would have been distraught had it gone the other way. #indyref

snp keith brown msp lists the heart of the nation by insisting the constitution is still the big issue. #indyref

Powerful No message from Edinburgh, 61%. The fat lady is singing.#indyref

I hope both sides graciously accept #indyref result and get together to make Scotland and the UK better and fairer! #thepeoplehavespoken

Big no in #indyref from oil and gas heartlands of Aberdeen and Shetland

The No side has won the referendum. However, there will be some changes coming #ScotlandDecides #indyref

There are no words for how I feel. I feel like a little kid overwhelmed by emotions that are too big for me #indyref

Someone filming with an iPad. Fuck Fife. #scotdecides #indyref

C'mon, #Scotland, without you our Union flag would just be called 'flag'. How rubbish is that? - I think that's what swung it. #indyref

Not what I had hoped for in #indyref it would seem it is always better the devil you know.

The no campaign fought for Scotland too: Too wee, too stupid, too poor, too feart. #indyref.

Fife NO. Scotland officially still in the UK. #indyref

That's it. 'No' across the line. Bed time! #indyref

FINALLY I CAN GO TO FUCKING BED#indyref

more like you're delighted you and your Labourite, anti-Scotland chums can keep snouts in the trough. #indyref

wish we here on Pakistan learn a thing from Scotland. Indeed commendable. Lots of respect for Scottish people. #indyref

Massive respect  well done to 1 of the most principled  intelligent people I've had the pleasure of working with #indyref

Watching the #indyref results roll in Truly democracy in action.

Scotland you just broke my heart. #indyref

I'm not going to bed til all votes are returned and I can see the sunrise over Great Britain #bettertogether #indyref

Thats it, Scotland votes no, fucking shite #indyref

Can't believe Fife voted no, absolute ashamed #indyref #ScotDecides

Has Alex Salmond been arrested? #indyref

Fife voted! Go you, and you voted to stay part of the UK That makes it an official overall No vote in #IndyRef

Fitting that it ended in Fife. I can go to bed for an hour or so. Congratulations to Gordon Brown and to the Scottish electorate. #indyref

interest in that the Deputy First Minister concedes not the First Minister. #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

Fife 55% No and 45% Yes. Making the official result of the referendum no #indyref

Yesssssss IT'S OFFICIAL - NO HAS WON! Fife YES 45% NO 55%..SCOTLAND VOTES NO #indyref

So that's it - Fife declared and NO has officially won #indyref #bettertogether

Well done Scotland. Good decision for all #indyref

After the Fife result, we can say, definitely, that the official result of the #indyref is 'No'.

Common sense prevailed and a huge endorsement to be proud to be Scottish and British #indyref

I'm off to bed with pride in my country. I feel like a weight has been lifted. Onwards and upwards. #indyref

Glad to see Scotland stay, hope the rest of the UK takes a lead  has such a big turn out come general elections!! #indyref #ToriesOut2015

That's it, Scotland voted no to independence. The United Kingdom remains as it is. But we made our voice heard #indyref

#Scotland has officially decided to remain in the union with the United Kingdom. #IndyRef

Those poor Scots. So depended on that colonial mind set. They almost had balls, that count? #IndyRef

It's official, Scotland rejects independence #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Catalonia region to push for referendum so that they can finally finish building the sagrada familia #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #Fife has called it - it is now official, Scotland has rejected independence - An unbreakable Union? I think so! #indyref

We've won. I am so, so, so relieved! #indyref

30. FifeYes 114,148 (55%) | No 139,788 (55%) FIFE TAKES IT TO A NO VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE.#IndyRef #ScotlandDecides #Fife #No

And the 'no' has it Totally worth the all nighter! #indyref

Scotland votes no. We really are better and stronger together #indyref

Fife returns a No vote at 6.08am #indyref confirming the people of Scotland have voted No

#indyref Och. Scots are running scared of seperating. We had hope people and you butchered it.

Am I fuck paying my licence fee now after that sharade #indyref #bbcbias

Proud  happy to remain #Scottish  #British. Great to see democracy in action  great to see complacent Westminster shaken up #indyref

There we are folks - Scotland has rejected independence #bettertogether #indyref

It's official. Thank you Scotland. Goodnight. #indyref

Made it! (through the election night coverage that is) #indyref  #NaffGraphics

Glad to have woken up in a country that is still Great Britain. #IndyRef

No will top 2 million. Still means an incredible 1.6-1.7m voted for independence #indyref

Never been so disappointed in the result of a vote but perhaps the fact that 45% wanted independence shows that change is wanted #indyref

If today taught us anything that is its time for change!!!!#getridofthetories #indyref

Fife no vote here tips #no to victory in #indyref

Scotland decides to stay, excellent. Now where's my referendum on having an English Parliament? #indyref

HURRAH! I can't cope if we have to go through all this again in 2017. #indyref

#indyref that woman on bbc news. She's cheering and happy why? That things are going to get worse? Gutted.

I don't want the people of Scotland to be deflated, disenfranchised, disillusioned because the majority rejected self governance. #indyref

Thank you #indyref, thanks Scotland. We're still the United Kingdom of Great Britain  Northern Ireland, politics changed for the better.

It's official. We remain #United. Change to come, of course. But stability and #bettertogether overall.  Thank you voters. #indyref

30/32 counties have voted, it's declared a no vote from Scotland! #indyref

Mr. Salmon: I hope you don't end up fishing those fish in Yemen.#Indyref

Scotland the Brave?? My fucking arse! #traitrouscunts!!! #indyref

Would like to see far, far less of Dan Snow and more of Gordon Brown and even George Galloway this morning. #indyref

So glad that the Scottish have said no. A union which has stood for centuries will stand well into the 21st century #indyref

Just woken up to the news. Scotland, I love you, more than ever before X #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Great to hear we are still  united ..#indyref :-D

Cameron not wasting time with #indyref momentum 'Scottish MPs will no longer be allowed to vote on English laws'

Scotland has officially voted No. Now it's time for the politicians to fulfil what they promised: change! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Scotland votes NO to independence!So happy to see my country stay together. Let's take opportunity to improve things for everyone. #indyref

Thank you Fife. Thank you for getting the right decision over the line #indyref

Fife delivers it. #indyref am relieved. Now we all need to make the change. Lesson for UK. Lesson for Westminster elite. Change.

I would rather watch news reports with a bunch of celebrating drunk Scotts than a smug David Cameron any day. #indyref #ImHalfBritToo

And that's all folks! Scotland has spoken. We want to remain UNITED. #indyref OVER!

I kid, I kid. In all seriousness, it's been a treat to watch #indyref unfold. I learned quite a bit abt Scotland that I didn't know before.

Alistair working on speech with the brilliant Rob Shorthouse as NO pass the #indyref winning line.

Scotland's #indyref totals (29 of 32 declarations):Yes 1,398,540 (44.6%)No 1,737,464 (55.4%) v

Ok #Scotland it's time to call Mr Wallace. #indyref

It is all over. Everyone had an opportunity to make a change, we decided against it. Right or wrong. It was our choice. Devastated. #indyref

Now I hope Alex Salmond does one #indyref #jogonpal

And it's a No - Scots reject the chance to break away from the UK after No votes dominate in independence referendum. #indyref

Yes, Nick, but there'll be little oil left in 15 years' time. But lots of renewables, hopefully. #indyref

Well, Scotland, that was a massively wasted opportunity. #indyref

Disappointing but unsurprising that fear, late promises and the mass media won #indyref Great campaign that enfranchised poorest

surprised with the #indyref vote. I honestly thought it was a yes vote throughout all the talk/debates this week. UK will never be the same.

Let's party for 0-hour contracts and minimum wage #indyref

Scottish voters have rejected independence, results show No vote exceeds 50 percent of turnout #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Well looks like we'll definitely need that drink #indyref

Scotland has officially said No to independence #indyref

Watch out - today is a good day in which to bury bad news. Look beyond #indyref

All votes arent in  yet  what about highlands#reflive #indyref #yesscot #scotlanddecides #bbcindyref

#indyref Not too wee, not too poor, just too stupid, too scared  too manipulated.

#Scotland has rejected independence but things likely change in the #UK.There'll be a long discussion on what needs to change. #indyref

Salmond says 'that's it for a generation' and Spurgeon says 'that means 15 years'. Is that the average age of mothers in Scotland? #indyref

voter turnout in #indyref is just astounding and inspiring, that's how you do democracy #wow

The amount of people happy to swallow lies and empty promises is possibly the worst part. #indyref #gullible

Right, we'll just have to focus on global permanent revolution. That was always the end goal anyway. ;-) #indyref #revolution

It is now statistically impossible for Yes to win. Thank-you, Fife. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

You have it spot on there - this is not the end, and when the big promises are not met, there will be another #indyref

So Scotland votes No. #indyref #scotref a moment in history and a huge period of change still ahead no doubt for us all.

Thank you for saving our country! God Save the Queen! #indyref #bettertogether #battleforbritain

If only we could get 87% turn out in the General Election , maybe we'd feel better represented . #indyref #scottishindependence

Ecstatic to be both British and Scottish. Let the hard work begin to devolve the powers needed for change #indyRef #bettertogether

Astounded by the level of people who voted still tbh #indyref

The silent majority proved that less is more #bettertogether #indyref

And it's official. The United Kingdom stays united. Love you in ANY form, Scotland. #indyref

I prefer blue collar Glasweegians that bleed true blue for Scotland. #Scotlandecides #indyref #VoteYesScotland

I'll keep this for the rest of my life, no matter what. #IndyRef #ScotDecides

I have full independence and I make a right fucking hash of it. #indyref #crumbofcomfort

The United Kingdom: the greatest democracy on Earth. For every person who'd like to leave, there's 100 more who'd love to join. #indyref

Proud of my nation tonight. More than 85% turnout is a lesson in democracy for the Western world. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Really good interactive graphic from showing latest results from #indyref with 30 of 32 councils declared:

That's why it's called the United Kingdom and not the Magic Kingdom (where everyone gets their way). #indyref #Scotland #UKsGotWorkToDo

#indyref #ScotDecides YES we did it. NO thanks Mr Salmond

thought you would have something more thoughtful to say, given thousands of Scots wake up further from a fair society.#indyref

I shall now attempt to avoid news for today  try to find some analysis in the papers this W/E, *thoughtful, intelligent analysis* #indyref

Genuinely heartbroken but let's move forward together and get the change.  #indyref

just imagine the sigh of relief that insufferable David Cameron is breathing.. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Scotland can now light a pipe, put its slippers on, put its feet up and watch #UKIP win its first MP and wonder what it has done. #IndyRef

After year of stagnation, low job opps, division and sometimes anger: Career moved for Alex Salmond  #indyref

Good result for #Scotland and great show of peaceful voting and democracy. An example others should follow. #indyref

4 countries; Wales, Northern Ireland, England  Scotland, we face the new day united under the colours of one flag. #indyref

Just reading some of the #indyref feedNeed to recognise that VERY strong feelings on both sides, I reckon

Ironically all I can say now is YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES #indyref

#indyref today I'm ashamed to be a Fifer but proud to be a dundee fan

We feared blood following an #indyref 'Yes' win, but it will be spilt in Westminster regardless over what comes next, especially in England.

Florida! Florida! Florida! MT Scotland's #indyref will reject independence, BBC predicts

I'm glad #Scotland made the right choice. Now we can start to build a better future together within our United Kingdom. #IndyRef

Implications for Spain from Scotland's #indyref? Can Madrid learn anything from Better Together campaign?

(contd) Proud that debate centred on those who had less, lived less, mayb were loved less. Proud that we conducted ourselves well #indyref

What are we going to talk about now? #indyref

Great news to wake up to - we are still a United Kingdom - Scotland said No - fantastic news! #indyref

And the results are in Scotland votes NO, and will remain in the UK. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

The silent majority have spoken just because you shout the loudest doesn't mean you'll win #justsaying #indyref

going it alone better how? Scots have 11.8% more spent on them per capita than the whole UK:  #indyref

They fought so hard, but it's not what the people wanted. It's not the end, but it is over, for now. #indyref

if you want a #fournations historian of #HomeRule, I'm your man #justsaying #indyref #federalism

Moray votes NO in Scotland's #indyref:Yes 27,232 (42.4%)No 36,935 (57.6%)Turnout 85.4%

Scotland has decided. live from Edinburgh with all the reaction to #indyref result for #GMWales

Up early for Mercian Regiment do in #Wiltshire. Morning made better by seeing Scotland not saddling Wales with Tories for eternity. #indyref

We have risen above petty differences and chosen what's best for our nation. I've never been a prouder Scot. #IndyRef

Nothing's going to change. We could have taken power for our country and all it's decisions but we didn't. And it's disappointing. #indyref

Proud of the folk delivering a yes vote in our area! #IndyRef

Delighted, relieved that Kinross  Kent, Dunbar  Devon, Lothian  London remain together in United Kingdom. Devolution to come! #IndyRef

Song for the day - Kylie Minogue - Better The Devil You Know. :-) #indyref

Was the low 75% turnout in Glasgow due to fear by no voters of repercussions from yes voters? #justasking #indyref

Although the #indyref is over the true test and fight for the opinion of the scottish people comes in the next 4months #TickTockWestminster

Whether you voted yes or no, I'd like to wish the people of #Scotland a  good Friday  a brighter future. :) #indyref

I hope England goes for independence. #indyref

I hope it is appreciated that many No votes were 'No, not yet' or 'No, not quite' rather than 'No, not ever'. #indyref

I really do feel the troggs in London's promises are going to just be false promises. #JustSaying #indyref

Will be expected to stand down nowHe clearly represents what the majority of Scottish people don't#ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Scotland puts its faith in promises from Westminster. Hard to see that - continued dependence - as anything but a disappointment. #IndyRef

Scenes of joy as the camp celebrate their #indyref victory - here's

We've just heard from president who's now in the ITV studios. It's looking like an appearance around 6.25am #swib #indyref

Heartbreaking this! Its worrying how many people fell for the lies from the no campaign #indyref

One final count left in the Highlands, but Yes cannot win. #nothanks prevails 55-45 #indyref

So for all the huff and puff Scotland has bottled it like the fella in Perth with the first iPhone. #indyref

A victory for fear over hope and optimism, gutted #indyref #YesScotland

Scotland opts for devolution rather than independence #indyref results as the proponents for 'No' to independence win the referendum vote.

Highland still hasn't declared. But No is over the top with over 1.9 mill votes (1.8 mill needed). #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Well Done Scotland!!!!! Proud of the vote, Proud of the turn out now comes the time for positive change together xx #indyref #scotland

is a traitor and a treasonous trouble markerI would pull the lever myselfif you could be hanged #indyref #theunionworks

Officially #BetterTogether! Now let's all return to being nice to each other! #indyref

So, the cartoon from 1979 still true #indyref ht

Remaining park of the UK is the sovereign will of the people of Scotland but well done to both sides of the campaign #ScotDecides #indyref

Scotland votes to remain part of UK as the historic referendum reaches it's end - amazing scenes as 300yr union continues #indyref

This is a massive opportunity for the UK to build on unparalleled political engagement  prove that it really is Better Together #indyref

Scotland has spoken. GUTTED! However, a voice has been heard  things must change. Proud of ALL of us. Democracy is the winner #indyref

So No voters can never moan about anything ever WM do ever again and they love moaning!It's their worst nightmare! #indyref

The official vote is now in. My condolences to Mel Gibson and his family #Scotland #indyref

Good decision Scotland!! You know it makes sense!! #indyref

Not really arsed about #indyref but glad Salmond lost, he's a fucking knobead!

While the #indyref result is horribly disappointing, it's worth noting that over 1.5 million Scots voted in favour independence.

Turnout 88%, that's how you participate to a vote if your country is worth you something (Italians did you see that?!) #indyref #reunitedK

Politicians on all sides doing their best to sound humble   conciliatory following vote.  This is progress #indyref #democracy

No, no, thrice no 84% turnout #indyref brilliant. if only we could get that in the #generalelection. just admitted defeat

What has happened in Scotland today should bring real change across the UK, this has been a wonderful day for democracy #indyref

Alex Salmond: thank you fir 1.7 million votes for Scottish independence #indyref

It's like that painfully long weekend you have family stay over and then they decide to stay another day. #indyref

Tony Roper should be up there.what a shag #indyref

always liked Glasgow more than Edinburgh me!! #indyref

The US continues to demonstrate their stance of complete non-interst in #indyref with cliched statements on results:

#indyref  I am a Yank with Scot and English blood on my dad's side. I commend the dignity shown #ifollowback #honor

So Scotland don't hate England quite as much as they make out then? #indyref

Impressed w/how both sides handled the #IndyRef regardless of who won. Be proud! The US could learn from you. Good luck on future talks!

And that's a no. It has been declared. I'm going to bed. Goodni  uh, morning. #indyref

Alistair Darling was weak but put the passion into the No campaign -  was listened 2 thank goodness #indyref

#indyref I congratulate Scotland on a turnout of 85-90%! I'm sure if the UK follows that example next year we can oust an unjust Tory Reign

Independence 'is now a movement and it won't stop' #indyref

Very nice stat sorting for Scotland vote from BBC #indyref

Salmond said what he thought Scots wanted to hear. But Scots too canny to believe his claims they would do better out of the UK. #indyref

Well its official even though it was sorted hours ago the kingdom is still united the #novote wins in #Scotland in the #indyref

Relief! And now some sleep. Well done to all my fellow activists, enjoy some rest! #indyref #theythinkitsallover #itisnow

I wasn't sure how I felt about #indyref, not that my opinion matters, but now that it's over, I'm a bit disappointed

Salmond calls on people to unite behind will of the Scottish people #IndyRef

Fuck sake. No increase in life expectancy for the rest of the UK then. You had one job Scotland #indyref

what a disappointing day for scotland #indyref  its a shite state of affairs indeed.

Bet William Wallace is fucking pissed tonight. #indyref

#indyref Alex Salmond calls on nation to accept the No victory.  But Yes votes are substantial.

As someone whose heritage straddles both sides of the border I am very happy this morning #indyref

No matter how you side, Scotland is demonstrating the proper democratic spirit and method. They can hold their heads high. #indyref

Personally, the right result. But now is the time for Cameron  Co. to deliver, time for change. Rule Britannia. #indyref

And David Cameron will always be known as the needy partner that promises to change but still cries in public, creating a scene. #indyref

So with the Fife result it's a 'no' to Scotland leaving UK - but more devolution still on its way  #indyref

Salmond you make me sick!!  #indyref

So it's decided #indyref People in Britain waking up to a wake-up call - unprecedented turnout, outcome unclear till well into counting.

Scotland, you voted to stay.Show Westminster  London why they should listen to your voice!  #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Any reaction to the news you are waking up to?  Get in touch.  | #IndyRef  #TD1Live

I am surprised I didn't think there would be such a large margin between the two camps #indyref

Bad opening remark, Alex. You're First Minister of *all* Scotland. Thank all of us who turned out. #indyref

Relieved and slightly emotional, Great result in Scotland #indyref

RT:y should he?He dreamed a dream Sky Sources: Alex Salmond will not stand down as leader of Scottish National Party #IndyRef

That's bought another ten years before the next #indyref. I look forward to seeing what #Scotland does with it.

you WANKER! Hope you are happy now! You have just screwed over mine and many others future children! #indyref #embarrassment

#Indyref results confirm Scotland has rejected independence. DavidCameron statement expected from7am.

I'm going to bed now proud of #YesScotland  #Glasgow #Dundee - but disappointed  fearful about tomorrow #indyref

Hold this to be true: this is not a victory for no or a defeat for yes. This is simply the Scottish Nation expressing their will. #indyref

Good choice Scotland and now I get to go to bed! #finally #indyref

Regardless of whether you're happy with #indyref result, it should remind us how lucky we are to have such a magnificent democratic process

Salmond's LED background makes him look like a robot #indyref

Scotland votes no, phew, but wow as well, such an amazing display from Scotland! #indyref #ScotlandDecides #theworldswatching

Well done team, now we can all get some sleep! #indyref

it seemed like there wasn't much of a plan if the Yes campaign won. hence, I bet the No vote #indyref

We have let the future generations down. Let's see if Westminster live up to their promise of more devolution #indyref

Sorry, dear Scotland, let Russia first set its 100 peoples free. Ukrs need strong UK now. Your time soon. But heart with YES! #Indyref

Alex Salmond says he accepts the verdict of the people of Scotland. #indyref

Don't worry, #Scotland - there's always next time. But thank you for kicking Westminster in the complacency. They needed it. #IndyRef

#Scotland #Indyref results via   . Yes: 45% (1.6m votes) No: 55% .Turnout 84.1% .Pending Highlands' results still to come in

Alex Salmond: I accept the result and pledge to work in interests of Scotland and UK #Indyref

#Scotland having said No #indyref, it's a big Yes  a model for Civilised Democracy, lessons for d world  here in India

I am devastated, but time to move on and heal and for Westminster to step up to the plate and promise these powers #indyref

Alex Salmond says Scotland expect the vows from the three leaders to be delivered in rapid course #indyref

However let's not forget 1.6m votes for #indyref is amazing, 86% turnout, 16  17 year olds voting for 1st time - ok I'm done!

A no vote to independence does not reflect a no vote for new powers to be devolved to Scotland #indyref

Thank you Scotland, for choosing to stay within the UK. From the heart, England really, really needs you. Thank you. Democracy wins #indyref

Wonder how the #catalunyans are feeling about the #novote in Scotland this morning. A blow to them for sure. Cerveza anyone? #indyref

Phew looks like i won't be getting deported ! Right choice Scotland #nothanks  #indyref

Gordon Brown for first minister? Wouldn't rule it out #indyref

Good morning, UK! So happy we're not breaking up. #indyref #scotlandsaysno #phew #canigobacktosleepnow #lovescotland

In Hong Kong's Scottish pub - HK media looking for reactions to results - chuffed the world is watching #indyref

Scotland, good on ye for deciding. You may not have independence, but you have a Wimbledon champ. England can't take that away #indyref

*at this stage* and *no such thing as No voters only deferred Yes voters* slippery Salmond. #IndyRef

..or you could have moved to Scotland and voted No. #indyref

Salmond making speech accepting defeat  Follow here #indyref

I'm really happy for Gordon Brown though. Widely hated  seen as dour but the passion he threw behind the campaign was admirable #indyref

at this point, no matter what we say, it's a moot point. #indyref is dead. Until next time #Scotland

Salmond eager to hear about those promises from Westminster. #indyref

Only 86% turnout in the #indyref #Scotland? Pfaf! Come to Arabia to teach you how to get 99.9% in OUR elections. Your democracy is flawed!!

Said it last night, say it this morning. Are you watching #ISIS ? its called democracy, its how we do things here in civilisation. #indyref

I find it strange to be so emotionally invested in an election while simultaneously not having any strong opinion on the outcome. #indyref

Did the H drop off Eck's forehead? #reddwarf #indyref

Now that #Scotland has thankfully seen sense, let's hope  crawl back under the rock they came from! #indyref

William Wallace would be disappointed, Scotland. #IndyRef #Freedom #ScotlandDecides

don't be grumpy, accept majority and move on!! Work together #indyref

The people have voted how fortunate we are to live in a democracy #indyref

Disgusted. Can't believe people have threw away their independence. #indyref

People of Scotland well done common sence #bettertogether #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

'One Scotland' is the backdrop as he speaks in Edinburgh - it's also on his Facebook page  #indyref

Unionist parties MUST make good on their pledges. Or else second #indyref  is coming. And we know how that will end up.

you Scots get a pretty good deal! #facefacts #wiseup #indyref

It's official: Sean Connery, scotch and Shrek are still British.  #indyref

How did David Cameron win? By making promises. He's better not betray. We'll see he doesn't get away with that. #indyref #Scotland

#indyref has been thrilling and, judging by turnout, a smash hit. I look forward to the inevitable sequel, expected late 2017

Incredible speech from Alex Salmond. He's a grubby wee shite, but this is gracious and inspiring. #IndyRef

The reunited kingdom: Scotland gives a clear 'No' to independence in historic referendum  55 vs 45% #indyref

You mark my words, I don't believe that this was a once in a lifetime chance.For all Salmond said, he is still a wily politician. #indyref

Alex Salmond says we won't be able to go back to politics as usual again #indyref

Thank you the people of Scotland for making the right choice #indyref

Historic opportunity missed. Pity. Won't come back again soon. #indyref

Not too disappointed about the outcome of #indyref because at the end of the day, what's good for Scotland is what the Scottish people want.

It may have been no,but #indyref has shown a clear schism in the UK. Will Queen attempt to pour oil on troubled waters today?Surely she must

Congrats, Activists like you helped keep the Union together. #indyref

Salmond says vote was a victory for democracy - 'It touched sections of the community who've never been touched by politics' #indyref

intelligence over nationalistic hysteria wins the day then. Congratulations Scotland. #indyref #loveUK

#indyref #salmond still fucking talking.  Just say Oh I lost and piss off!

Looks like the 'Nos' have it. Follow updates through the day on  #indyref

Dignified response by Alex Salmond, well said #indyref

New politics in #Scotland despite no-vote?  Let's hope we can continue with such a level of political participation. #indyref

Time for Salmond to resign smug and dangerous man #resign #indyref

So salmon is rounding up the amount of votes yes got. Just like he rounded up oil, money, resources Scotland have. #indyref

#indyref #BetterTogether #ScottishReferendum Delighted Scotland is staying in the UK family, 55% no  45% yes. A day for #celebration

You can all change your profile pictures back to normal now. #indyref

As it's raining, I presume Scotland are still with us?#indyref #scotland #PissingItDown

Good show we tried hard, however fear wins. Utterly devastated. #indyref

I mean, fuck sake. People die for independence. We just had to stick a cross in a box, and we turn our nose up at it. Cunts. #indyref

So glad to be waking up still in the United Kingdom #indyref

#indyref  Very Glad Scotland decided to stay together but it has changed Britain politics forever,very good day for democracy

Be interesting to see if record 86% turnout in Scotland #indyref will ever be achieved again in future 'normal' elections? I doubt it?

I'm leaving with this. So disappointed in the outcome. It's going to hit us hard #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scotland

Looks like the #Yes are winning the #ScottishReferendum. #indyref has been a well fought referendum. Congrats to the people of UK.

Gutted is not the correct term to describe how I feel right now. Rejecting our own independence? I just dont understand. #indyref

Its all over!! Scottish referendum: Scotland votes no to independence confirmed  #indyref

Opinion Polls - never trust them! #indyref

Well no matter what the decision was going to be, we've all played a part in history. #indyref

A new dawn has broken, has it not? #indyref

Just got two Scots kicked out of a bar in San Francisco, CA for not being home to vote in #indyref  FECKIN RIGHT YE CUNTS! #YesScotland

Yeah that worked out great the last time, can't complain I suppose we voted to get shafted #indyref

Now that #indyref is over we can concentrate on important events. Who has an iphone6?

JUST IN: Scottish voters reject independence from UK by almost 10 percentage points #indyref

New anthem for Salmond's 'One Scotland'?  #indyref

do you the the #UK will adopt a more #Canadian system of govt? #indyref

Flash Gordon, Saviour of the Union. Fitting that the battle was won in Fife. #indyref

Well done First Minister accepts verdict of Scottish people.#indyref

Given I want a world without boarders,  I'm so glad there hasn't been another erected. #indyref #scotlanddecides

#IndyRef #Scotland 06:25h BST Yes 44'6% No 55'38% #Scotland says #BetterTogether

and its over. I get to keep my passport #indyref

I hope the and remember that there's an election in May. #indyref #FurtherDevo

Heh, #indyref got a mention in the finale tonight!

When did Darling appear in Glasgow? He wasn't there earlier.#indyref

BREAKING - Scotland has voted 'no' and will remain as part of the United Kingdom #indyref

Listening to it's like getting beat 2-1 at football, and you keep banging on about the goal you scored!! #indyref

So deflated after that result How could 55% of the country be so blind to the absolute shafting Westminster deal us? #Ashamed #indyref

YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY I'M SO ECSTATIC, THANK GOD THEY'RE STUCK WITH US #indyref

I dread to think what his winning speech would have been like. What an odious little man. #indyref

#indyref #ScotlandDecides Here are the figures thus far (in picture form)

Britain remains Great. Good call, Scotland. #ScotlandDecides #IndyRef

Phew, don't worry boys, you are safe! #IndyRef

I'm so relieved by this result and I've been over awed by the passion which has been shown on both sides #indyref #democracy #novote

I am impressed by the turnout, a shame we can't have that during a general election #indyref

Fair play to Salmond for being humble. Best way for his voice to be heard in the future and more autonomy granted to Scotland #indyref

Well waking up today was always going to be interesting. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Cameron gambled and he got lucky once again. #indyref

Based on twtter it sounds like many Scots haven't been this dissapointed since yesterday. #IndyRef

#onescotland  That's alllet us move forward together #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Sad for #Scotland, sad day for freedom and equality. The unthinking majority have spoken; we'll continue to be ruled like sheep. #indyref

BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II's reaction to #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref You would get a response if it was possible to work out what the hell you were trying say.

I actually can't help but think that Gordon Brown (of all people) contributed to some last min No swings #indyref

Two famous Scots give their thumbs up #indyref #skynews #BBC #ScotlandDecides #bettertogether

If Salmond is going to round up nos and talk about 1.6m voting for independence let's remember 2m voted to remain in UK. Democracy #indyref

So it turns out more people voted NO than they thought would - 60 to 40, Scotland won't be independent #indyref #scottishindependence

Best news out of all of this is that Knockhill will remain on the BTCC calendar. #indyref

We should dispatch one of the Trident boats up the Clyde in symbolic celebration of our victory #indyref

Well done Good speech and thank you for bringing the attention of the world to Scotland. The new powerhouse in the UK #indyref

Scotland has done British democracy proud! Largest vote turnout in UK history #indyref Glad we didn't lose the tartan army #bettertogether

55% in favour of No in the #indyref? Hardly a resounding victory in anyones books. Going to be a lot of disappointed people out there today.

Scotland. Get ready for the Tories to now shit on you from a great height. #indyref

Well done Scotland.. now wait to be royally fucked over by Westminster for being uppity #indyref you deserve everything you are about to get

This has given complacency and indifference a well needed kick up the arse. Something that is sorely needed here in England. #IndyRef

UK will remain united. Scotland voted against independence and the #indyref is down. #ScotlandDecides

Turnout for the #indyref was more than 90% in places. Amazing how engaged people are when they believe voting will actually change anything.

Scotland decides it's better to live in poverty and a bug business driven society #indyref #freetheunicorn

Following Scotland's #indyref coverage = done.  Time to catch up on #RooseveltPBS documentary #americanpolitics

Love how all Pakistanis commenting on the #indyref in Scotland are making snide  references to dharnas and dhaandli :p #jalaybhunaypakistani

Scotland I salute you! Brave to the last! I have been moved by concession speech, and the trust he has in the people #indyref

First minister Alex Salmond calls on the people of Scotland to follow his lead  accept the democratic vote #indyref

Scotland voted No 55%.  I am relieved but at the same time it is strangely disappointing.  Very romantic, the idea of independence. #indyref

Alistair Darling is in the building and will give speech in 10 mins #indyref

As the parties begin, has been looking at the winners and losers of the #IndyRef  #RedBox

mashable: Glasgow votes Yes, but it's not enough  #indyref

I get the impression will be like Jason in the Friday 13th films, the cunt just won't die or fuck off #indyref

Well done Scotland, engagement in the political debate  full democratic process #indyref

If you have to raise your voice to win an argument, you lose the argument. The noisy nationalists have been beaten by integrity. #indyref

Surprised to turn the news on  Scotland are still part of the UK! #indyref

And the winner is the #EU. Scottish NO today will also mean NO to Brexit in upcoming EU-ref. Brussels will be delighted today. #IndyRef

Don't know if it's possible to keep my eyes open any longer #hurryup #indyref

Time to respect the vote and make some big changes, part of a UK solution to so many problems, change will happen #indyref

#indyref  I've trusted you with my vote.don't let me down by wasting it'No Thanks' time to deliver on your promises!

And now we hear why we should all vote x party for y in the UK general election next year. #indyref

#AlexSalmond leaves the stage after conceding the #indyref but not the argument

Well I won't be getting deports anytime soon Thank fuck.. That would've just added to my troubles! #indyref

the North of England will be pinched even further now. I predict a riot #indyref

putting a sign before him stating One Scotland after he just divided them is another shameful act by Alex Salmond #indyref

For some, the #indyref could simply have become a vote of fear v hope especially for those who have been undecided.

#indyref Congrats to both winners and losers. Good show.

Where does that leave ? Recognised as a wasted vote in Wales, people do no share that nationalist view, full stop! #indyref

why? This isn't a vote for u it's for Great Britain, this is bigger than u which you'll find it hard to believe #indyref

Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, accepts #indyref defeat

#indyref ask not what the union can do for you but what you can do for the union

I guess the Scottish people haven't seen Braveheart #indyref #wwallaceispissed

Morning all and a Happy Friday! Watching the #indyref result obviously.

Relieved at the result but the strongest signal yet that Westminster is quickly losing its grip on the nation #indyref #scotlanddecides

Can Scotland shut up now? #indyref

So happy our family of nations remains united! Westminster must keep ensure there is reform of our politics and constitution. #indyref

At this point a Russian invasion would be an improvement. #IndyRef

I can confirm that Scotland will not enter the Eurovision Song Contest in 2015 #indyref

Well BraveHeart 2 was a bit of a let down. #indyref

But seriously, are they going to finish counting the Highland votes or does it not matter anymore? #indyref

Well well Turns out Scotland have not voted for independence. #Indyref

Right you lot, please play nice. You may disagree with Salmond, as I do, but that was a man whose dream was just snatched from him. #indyref

Take note Dave, you can win elections without once debating the opposition on something as important as #indyref #Scotland

Think I got the gist of it, anyway! #indyref

Susan Boyle made an origami budgie and ate it, yet another celebrity ballot paper spoiled #indyref #results

16-17yo Scots not able to vote in general election. Hard putting that genie back in the box, their engagement in #indyref has been great

Scotland, the only country in history to reject its own independence. Bow down to your masters. Makes me sick. #indyref

Switched off when I saw the way #indyref was headed. Yes campaign made me feel proud to be Scots. No vote disgusts me. North Britain beckons

That very point is the shame, forcing people to vote. The #indyref has created a want  need to vote again!

Oh well, even my own constituency chose fear over hope Thanks #Moray :(At least the birds are singing this morning. #yesforever #indyref

Just woke up to Salmond conceding defeat. Hasn't resigned perhaps a 'no' 10 point lead is too narrow. #indyref

Scotland votes NO in #indyref Follow us for all reactions:  pic via

The moment when I have to accept that with my views of a more equal, just and progressive society, I will always be in a minority. #indyref

Yay so pleased about the No vote #indyref

Even rigging the #indyref with 16 year olds couldn't save Alex Salmond from defeat. #ScotlandDecides

Between the thunder storm and the referendum there was little sleep to be had last night! #IndyRef #thunder #lightning #ScotlandDecides

:( On their way.Also - #indyref has done more damage to Trident than you might imagine:

I think the sight of figures dancing and cheering with Tories will stick in my mind #Scotland #indyref

irrespective of what #ScotlandDecides ,they had a chance unlike occupied  #TIBET  #Balochistan .#IndyRef #FreeTibet

Glad that Scotland didn't separate..who would've gotten Capaldi in the partition of national assets #Whovian #indyref

worst thing the YesScots can do is fall into a depression. Let's hold them to account, when they betray, let's go again #indyref

Now stick to your promises to the Scottish people. No more #ToryLies #indyref

Scotland says get tae fuck #indyref Common sense prevails

Europe can sigh with relief as no vote signals end of disintegration of Union. #UKIP wake up we are all better off working together #indyref

The #unionjack would have looked out of sorts without St. Andrew  #indyref  cheers!

Call me Dave has no mandate from the English to give the Scots more powers without also giving England the same powers too. #indyref #UKIP

At a turnout of over 84% this was the single biggest democratic movement in modern UK history. What a moment for Scotland #indyref

Proud to be Scottish  part of UK. Common sense  democracy won in the end. Now back to work. Major turning point for UK #indyref

So no #Braveheart sequel now so!#Scotland  #middeltons delighted.. get to keep timeshare #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Twitter timeline has been full of #indyref all night, until the dairy farmers got up!

A fantastic result for the UK perhaps. A terrible one for Scotland. #indyref

I say 'there you go' but I'm a bit emotional. What an incredible thing. I'm happy we're staying together. #indyref

PREPARE FOR THISMay he sedition hush and like a torrent rush, Rebellious Scots to crush.  #indyref

While I admire #AlexSalmond for his tenacity, his politics lacked a lot of evidential support  he wasn't straight with voters. #indyref

Well that's wiped the smile off that sanctimonious self serving git #indyref

It's quite funny that they actually thought they would get independence and that of they did it would be a good decision lol #IndyRef

So when is it England's turn to have a referendum? #democracyforall #indyref

You will now have to make good on all those promises. A win for both sides. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

For a moment there I thought more people were gonna start taking responsibility for themselves #indyref

I wonder what the result would be in a UK gen election if it had the same level of turnout as #indyref? I'm guessing not the same as last?

Thank christ for the result. But wankers gloating and things like rule Britannia trending is what people vote yes for #indyref

Let's be honest here we have bullied Scotland for centuries  have again ! #indyref

Thank goodness for that! Time for generous dialogue and heartfelt reconciliation. Thank you, #indyref

426 tweets per minute are retaining #indyref as trending topic in Netherlands

Here's how some British newspapers are celebrating Scotland vote to stay in the UK: #indyref

No riots in the street. No violence. Yes accepting the result. All the fucking scare stories by the media already shown to be lies. #indyref

it's so wonderful to wake up to a still-United Kingdom, a country which can go on playing a positive role in a dangerous world #indyref

Let's focus this passion that's grown to still make a positive difference to all of our local communities! #indyref

If you break it down to Council areas the vote was Yes 10% No 90% - a really close run thing! #indyref

It's been a bad 24 hours for Scottish nationalist male golfers #indyref #ra

Updated front page of today's 'Scotland says No Thanks' #indyref #scotpapers

Nationalism might not be so popular but outwitted and the other two on #indyref #DevoMax #caughtsleeping

We're still on 31/32 - who's left to declare? #Indyref

Congratulations to the people of Scotland for demonstrating to the world how peaceful inclusive democracy works. #indyref

As a Tory I was proud to stand aside Labour and Liberals on this one. The UK is preserved through cooperation #indyref #bettertogether #UK

tweets to say he is 'delighted' by Scotland's decision:  #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Given Alex Salmond didn't want any powers devolved from the EU to Scotland why should he get any powers devolved from Westminster? #indyref

2 years of #indyref and only now am I aware that Nick Clegg is on twitter.

Yes votes in the no category? Fucking bullshit, #indyref #fix

This is only the beginning. We'll continue to fight for what's right. #indyref #Scotland

Whats going on with Highland Results? They run out of fingers and toes? #indyref

Well done #Scotland for using your democratic right to vote. What a great turn out - 86% #indyref

Too many people seem to prefer ghost stories and their wallets instead of their fellow human beings. #indyref

Scottish #indyref: a victory of #democracy  a defeat of those against use of ballots to solve political conflicts. Congrats #Scotland  #UK

Well done to Scotland with their decision to remain as part of the UK. #bettertogether #united #indyref #ScotlandDecides

What an election result this has turned out to be, one side got their way to stay British and the other gained more autonomy #IndyRef #Proud

Of course, this also means some 2 million people were so angry with status quo they wanted to *leave*. Things need to change #indyref

Now it's time for the bitter victory. DevoPlus is in the oven. #indyref

Proud of Scotland in terms of turnout. Amazing political engagement. Very proud of Glasgow for being brave. Interesting times ahead #indyref

Scotland, not really a country, just a region. #indyref

Once in a lifetime opportunity wasted. Welcome the child poverty and food banks and what not to come #indyref

Can't say over promised in #indyref. We don't know how many no voters were reassured by the promise of devomax.

If nothing else, British democracy can only do well out of this. Huge turnout and passionate debate on making a better Scotland. #indyref

Seems Li Na has taken it badly. I wish her all the best. Great fighter. #indyref #LiNa

Glad that Scotland have stayed with us #indyref being British is more important to me than being English

So we can still cheer on Andy Murray right? #indyref

#indyref Scotland votes no to independence 1914187 to 1539920 votes. Thank You Unionist!

I feel fragile and small. I want to be hopeful. I will be. But not yet. #indyref

One more area still to declare  a statement from the PM. Then I can sleep. *yawn* #indyref.

Donald Where's Your Troosers?- Andy Stewart! -  via #indyref Scotland Says No.  Donald wheres ya Troosers!

OK Scotland-great turnout, 16/17 year olds tuned-in, shows us how to make Big Politics go local. More please, south of the border! #indyref

LISTEN: captures the atmosphere at an #indyref party overnight in Inverness #r4today

#Scotland has rejected independence, #indyref results. Yes 45% 1,539,920  No 55% 1,914,187.

Might have a clear mandate from the people (myself) to go back to kip for a snooze. Underwhelmed by it all. #indyref

Regardless of whether you like the result or not I think we can all be proud of an 86% turnout. #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Here's hoping he's allowed nowhere near a ballot box! #voterigging #indyref #ScotDecides #voteyes

#ScotlandDecides, Rule Britannia, Tories, Cameron and even William Wallace trending in UK #indyref

TURNOUT NEARS 85%; HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE WW2 BOOM! #indyref #ScotlandDecides #Scotland

One thing that's impressive is the huge voter turnout for the #indyref #scotland the people have obvious chosen. A right decision too.

Who the f*ck is that clown hooting his car-horn at this time of the morning? Go back to bed, nothing to celebrate #Businessasusual #indyref

#indyref# from harlow so glad the Union stands and Salmond spoke of team Scotland pulling together. Team UK can pull together 4 everyone too

#indyref I hope this is the start of a more general devolution of power from Westminster.Smaller central govt = local people empowered.

Phew! Can I stay now? Happy it's NO. 85% turnout speaks of dignity  engagement. BTW: UK, don't forget that timetable for change. #indyref

Cannot get over it, best day of 2014! Been a long time coming, worrying about this! Now it's done, Scotland has spoken #indyref

As a British northerner, an Englishwoman, and an honorary Londoner, I'm relieved. #indyref 'you don't fix a marriage by getting a divorce'

Hope these vote rigging allegations aren't swept under carpet #indyref

So proud of Scotland. So relieved. Solidarity over separation. Decisive convincing win. #indyref #LabourNo #bettertogether

We need to remember. We've just voted to put weapons of mass destruction ahead of our children. I'm not going to settle with that. #indyref

#Nalbandian: Regardless of outcome this free expression of Scots' will is realization of selfdetermination #indyref

One rogue opinion poll? Is it too late for Dave to take some of those promises back? #indyref

Brown and Labour have sold out Scotland for English gold. #indyref

The silent majority had the loudest voice! #indyref

Dreamt Bob Geldof gave me some videos for xmas I didn't really want. Turns out it really happened. Thanks a lot, Bob. #indyref #wrongchoice

#ScotlandDecides Those who voted No must not have seen what Mel Gibson died for #indyref

#edinburgh feck! - Square Mile Wannabe - Could have been the new district with support of the peoples money - nae the fake casino! #indyref

Scotland voted, this divided a nation, let's work together unified, we should always have this kind of turnout #democracy #indyref

It's up to the people to decide whether it's off the agenda, not the politicians!! Keep the flame burning!  #atthisstage #indyref

55% No 44% Yes. Thank you Scotland for staying with us! Let's change the UK  Europe together  #indyref #thanksScotland

Oh dear. Looks like the Scots have bottled it! #indyref #bettertogether #VoteNo #VoteYes

and to think I stayed up all night gubbing eccies and drinking buckfast in expectation #indyref

#indyref Only 645 other MPs to be convinced. That assumes someone doesn't kill any legislation by other means.

Darling: today is a momentous day for Scotland and uk as a whole. Let bonds that tie us together never be broken. #indyref

Well Scotland you voted to stay in UK. But it was great to see you panic the complacent Cameron/Clegg/Miliband in past few weeks #indyref

I woke up to find that I'm still remaining in the UK but in a city that didn't like to #glasgow #indyref

We're #BetterTogether anyway! Hi #Scotland, I'm glad you're staying for the party! #ScotlandDecides #ScottishIndependence #Indyref

Scotland should be proud of the amazing turnout for #indyref .The people have spoken! The politicians must now deliver! #powertothepeople

here here chick! Hopefully change will come out of this. #gutted #indyref #Scotland

It's been confirmed Scotland WILL stay in the UK after the #indyref. has reaction on 95.5FM/1566MW

Spoiled ballots by local authority area #indyref

It's official: Scotland says NO! Thank- you Scotland. #indyref #bettertogether

Darling: every political party must listen to cry for change. #indyref

The very high turnout made a difference in legitimising Scotland's #IndyRef outcome.

Scotland has chosen. Democracy wins. #indyref #ScotlandDecides #hugascot #OneScotland #proud

Still going to wear my yes badge with pride knowing that I was part of the percentage that tried to change Scotland for the better #indyref

Now voting is over in #Scotland Nicola Sturgeon will now leave politics and take on the lead role in Billy Bremner - The Musical #indyref

Hearing Scotland has voted No as a Yes supporter #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Accept underdog status. After mighty effort take the lead. Other team bring on big name subs regain the lead and the chance is gone #indyref

#ScotlandDecides you can bring horse to water but you cannot make it drink #indyref #AlexSalmond

I hope the good people of Crimea and Russia followed #indyref. You know, just to have an idea of what #democratic referendum really is.

Up all night for the #indyref then sleep for a few hours then THIS EVENING I AM SEEING I am excited. #myfavouriteauthor

So result as expected by bookies all along. However has got what he wanted - DevoMax. #indyref

How many people shouts #VoteYes but secretly #VoteNo you fucking bottlers it wasn't even close #indyref #scottishindependence

#Salmond is a gambling genius - bluffed his way to double money for Scotland's tiny contribution to uk #indyref #cameronfoldedlikeacheapsuit

Happy The Scots have decided to remain a United Kingdom  I imagine the anti-climax will last a while for them #indyref

Woke up to a no vote from Scotland! #indyref

Alistair Darling: I know there are people who are committed to Scotland. They must continue to make their contribution. #indyref

Tories already on #r4today preparing their grab for more power  wealth for their own in the wake of the #indyref

When is the looting and rioting kicking off? #indyref

#IndyRef result has left me devasted but we'll fight on for the best for oor wee country!

So Scotland has rejected independence in historic vote. #indyref

Scotland stays - but what an overwhelming triumph for democracy we have witnessed #indyref

BBC tells the truth #VoteYes #indyref We also need a new #tag Love all in Scotland. Yes and No.Hope it makes sense

Feel so proud to be Scottish. Our voices will change UK politics. Everyone in the UK needs to ensure we drive through change #indyref

Excellent speech by Darling.  The one Salmond should have made. #indyref #statesman

We'll be watching, your federal vision surely has best mandate.#indyref

All the political parties must now translate their commitments to change into action -  Alistair Darling #indyref #Scotland

Dear Scotland, thanks for not tearing our country apart. Can we unite now and together give the Tories a kicking? #indyref

If we who supported keeping the Union regard this result as a political vindication, we are seriously deluded #indyref

My grampie George would have been tucking into a haggis this morning having been oot tossing a caber in his skirt. #OckAye #IndyRef

Could whitey right now but a guess that's what a get for actually believing that maybe half the country wouldn't be a cunt #indyref

#indyref  like wtf is wrong with these no sayers.  #scotland sob.

What a shame that elections don't generate the same turnout as #IndyRef . Every vote helps decide our future not just this one.

Want to try out this new free #moba? Check it oot here!  #indyref #ahshyte

cometh the hour cometh the man. You are not the man #AlexSalmond #indyref

Can we in rest of the Union now have a vote on whether we want Salmond, Sturgeon and co to stay? #indyref

A single Ardmore dampening the disappointment of the expected result says Bruce. #indyref

So glad that Scotland is staying part of the UK. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Malauradament no m'he equivocat Bon divendres a tothom #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref Let us remain one people as we continue to push forward with hope for the good of Scotland #onescotland

Victorious Darling seems st be speaking in front of giant chocolates.  #indyref

Darling looks what I imagine a male-Lauren Harries would look like all grown up. #indyref #ScotDecides

Fuck you Scotland. Wonder how long it will be until you regret this #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Unity over division. Thank you Scotland #indyref

Scotland saw sense and I'm strangely relieved #bettertogether #indyref

Seems like the 7% undecided all voted 'No'. When in doubt, stick #indyref

This music at the end of Alistair Darling's speech is making me want to watch some BT Sport. #IndyRef

#Scotland votes No. Here are the front pages the UK is waking up to right now   #indyref

Every nation in the United Kingdom deserve the same right to vote on their independence now- England, Wales  Northern Ireland #indyref

So I want to hear from my UK Tweeps. Are you happy about the vote result? #Scotland #indyref

RT if you think David Cameron should resign anyway.#indyref

After 4 nights of insomnia, losing a good chunk of followers over it  a mere 48 tweets; Im gonna be cool  say I was never worried #IndyRef

Updated dawn edition front page of today 'Scotland says No Thanks' #indyref #scotpapers

it's time rural English MP's grew some and ended the hopelessly outdated and unfair Barnett formula! #indyref #bettertogether

Inspired by the Yes people I'm seeing on here this morning talking about continuing to work to build a fairer Scotland. #indyref

Alistair Darling says 'yes change is to come' but he also suggests #ScottishParliament already has powers it's not using #indyref

I bet Salmond is relieved that he now doesn't have to come up with answers to any of the questions Better Together asked him #indyref

Well done Scotland. Gordon Brown on Christmas card list, Andy Murray off. Time for a snooze before Cameron ruins my day. #indyref

Next Scottish vote in a Generation's time. When the Oil runs out. #interesting #indyref

Darling: we've made a decision for progress  change for Scotland the UK. Come on Scotland, let's get on with it. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

It's funny that Alex spoke from Edinburgh (which voted No), and Darling spoke from Glasgow (which voted yes). #indyref

I've just spent 3 hours watching he results of #indyref and responding to tweets! Sleepy time now 3

Celebratory confetti cannons in the No camp seems a little excessive. #indyref

Dear Scots, thanks. We'll make this worth your and our while, honest. #indyref

The silent have spoken and voted NO, together we are stronger #indyref #Scotland #UnitedKingdom

#Scotland gets devolved powers and economic strength. Still not sure who won?! #indyref

Well done Scotland!  A triumph of common sense over petty tribalism. #indyref

Scottish by birth, British by vote, Highlander by the grace of God. #indyref

Well Done Scotland. Let's get to work. #OneScotland #indyref #ScotlandDecides

the #indyref has indeed divided a nation lets hope that can be repaired and the nation can go forward with new powers together

Key is whether Lab votes (Glasgow, Dundee, N. Lanarkshire) will return to Lab in 2015  or vote elsewhere #indyref

half my facebook feed seems to be researching Canadian immigration procedures now #indyref

Have English politicians listened? The answer was 'no', not 'Westminster Parliament'. Morning it is, but wake-up call to UK? No. #indyref

..realisation that there is a desire for change. Neither half of the debates views can be ignored and changes will occur. #indyref

must surely resign, like they expected Cameron to? On the cusp of political wilderness? #ScotlandOut #indyref

I woke up to see that Scotland is still in the UK. Well, that's good news I guess. #indyref

BREAKING: NATO does not recognise the result of the referendum in #Scotland #AskAndersGoFoghYourself #indyref

True democracy in action when 85% of the electorate participated on a truly momentous decision #indyref

Breaking News: Scotland votes No and continues raising its kilts to take it in the ass by Westminster #indyref #ScotlandDecides

After all that , it's as you were. #indyref

Gutted, empty and heartbroken, but I will always be proud that I voted Yes.Goodnight Scotland. You were but a beautiful dream x#indyref

We live to see another day in this beautiful and dysfunctional  Union. DJ, drop that devolution. #indyref

In old days an independence attempt wouldve been crushed with an army n the would-be-king meeting a grizzly end. #indyref #bloodydemocracy

Thank you Scotland, I wouldn't have coped well with rejection #indyref

Very curious what the reaction will be like in Glasgow today. #indyref

Thank goodness. Now let's stop the fighting. #indyref #votedno

Congrats Scotland. You've proven that democracy  politics matter. Incredible to see nearly 4 million vote  participate. #indyref

So Scotland said no, a whole lot of fuss but in the end nothing really changes #indyref

Disappointed with result but fantastic, positive, engaging campaign that will change Scottish AND British politics #indyref

The Prime Minister will make a statement following the Scottish Referendum results just after 7am. #indyref

I know a lot will be disappointed today, but now is the time to work together to build a better country for all. #indyref

Dear #Westminster,When do I get my free #PepsiMax?  If it's OK, can I have cherry flavour?  Yours sincerely, A #Yes Voter in the #IndyRef

Impressed by voter turnout gor #indyref, the only way to affect social change is to use your democratic rights! #ScotlandDecides #No

does this mean we get the uk eu referendum we were promised? It won't go through but at least pretend at democracy #indyref

I get the allure of independence, thorough as an outsider I'm glad to still be living in a country that has the awesome Scots in it #indyref

Well done Scotland, you've changed the face of Britain forever.Make sure the multi-millionaires at Westminster keep their promises #indyref

Thank You people of Scotland, We're Better Together. #indyref

I think we should try and get independence for the Highlands!! #indyref

Talk of unity from the man who led Project Fear #indyref. How does he propose doing that for the 1.6 million who preferred hope over fear?

#scotlanddecides #indyref  Is it part of the new devolution plans that BBC are now presenting their weather forecasts from Scotland?

Whether it favours you or not the only fair system is a federal UK. #uk #indyref

thank's so much for your #indyref efforts. Jim, you need a bigger role at WM. Ruth you need same at Holyrood

no doubt will still try an claim that by losing the vote he has some mandate to do something or other #indyref #no

Great speech by Alistair. Today Scots voted for faster, better, safer change. Let's move forward together. #indyref

London now faces the excruciating task of standing by its promises, or face another #indyref they won't be able to stop with lies

#indyref Scotland has rejected independence Glasgow Yes Not enough, Yes 45 No 55

Let's face it, Alex Salmond actually got exactly what he wanted - maximum power without having to give anything up. #indyref

It was a big ask sha, to ask people to dissolve a 307 year old union. A really big, tough ask. In the end. They obviously couldn't. #indyref

Scotland ya shitbags. If Liverpool had the independence vote the 2 choices would beA) YESB) FUCKIN DEFO#Shitbags #indyref

The majority couldn't see beyond the initial discomfort and uncertainties of independence. The what's in it for me now generation #indyref

Best thing about #indyref result? High turnout. You *can* engage Brits in politics if you're talking about something they care about.

Bullying proved to be no substitute for unanswered questions, thankfully #indyref

Right decision #Scotland. Still much good to come out of this campaign. Gotta move forward  adapt now, together. #bettertogether #indyref

Pundits seem indecisive on whether or not 55-45 is decisive or not. Oh dear. #indyref

45% is a staggering amount, like much more than most would have ever thought, which acts as some consolation for a positive future #indyref

Scots reject independence from UK  - Scotland the fairly, but not too, brave!  #IndyRef

I'm proud of how we knocked a 20 point lead off the No campaign through people power alone; only the media save them #YesScotland #indyref

Stayed away from posting my opinions but just woke up and can only say I'm delighted with the result #delightedtobeunited #indyref

So happy that we're staying together. #indyref

Huge sighs of relief in Westminster this morning #indyref

The #ScottishReferendum may be over but today still promises to hold some ground-breaking news. We'll hear from the PM shortly #indyref

not issuing a statement after #indyref result. I assume they're all off to have a nice English breakfast.

Devolution is the wrong direction to be going, but if that's where we're going lets do it properly #indyref

What next for Salmond? Vote for the People's Republic of Glasgow? #indyref

Good choice Scotland. Alex Salmond should now resign. #indyref

Glued to #indyref coverage. What a night, eh Scotland!

#indyref how long can pad out this shite. It a NO. That's it. I'm currently watching homes under the hammer

social, health and financial inequity exists across the whole union. The right to change that shouldn't be determined by borders #indyref

Hopefully the #NoScotland vote will devolve powers to Wales, Scotland  NI for the good of Britain. The #indyref is the start of change.

Thanks, Scotland. We'll have a G+T at the reunion. #indyref

Individual results and turnout for each county is fascinating. I wish I knew the history of those areas to understand why. Google! #indyref

The biggest thing I've gotten out of the #indyref is nobody likes what so ever. Shit PM

Thanks for holding on Scotland, from a southerner. United  Great we remain. Hope this drives positive political change for all #indyref

Glasgow and West Dunbartonshire are the only patriotic places in Scotland to Vote Yes #indyref #WevotedYes

Och Scotland. You'll have had your #indyref then? Now awa' n boil ya heed!!

30 years from now all you No Voters will be ashamed! When your grandkids ask you what you voted you'll lie and say it was Aye! #indyref

Now that more devo is happening, it MUST be UK wide. That's what One Nation should mean. Fair settlement for everyone in UK #indyref

Hey #Scotland , how are you doing today?!? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#indyref results. #ScotlandDecides close race #bettertogether. I'm glad you stayed

Scotland narrowly votes to save the union. #indyref

It's game on Everyone who voted in #indyref It's all down to NewLab, Tory's, Lib to now deliver on promises, if they don't then they're sunk

If 75% turned out in Glasgow, then the reality is only 40.1% of the city voted for change. Not a victory for yes at all #indyref

Just watched Once More With Feeling (what an episode), and the final question is also relevant now: where do we go from here? #indyref

Thank you Scotland. You made politics interesting. You showed the world how democracy works. And you made the right decision. #indyref

Cop that, Mel Gibson. Your nefarious plans for an independent Scottish homeland foiled again. #indyref

#indyref Can We All Just Get Along Now! Last thought of the day - Scotland so near but yet so far. So its Goodnight frm me  Toodles frm him

Nice of Scotland to confirm that they are just a big county. #RuleBritannia #indyref

Woot woot, Vernon Bogdanor is on talking about the English q  slumbering beast of English nationalism #indyref

The current structure of the UK is an affront to good design #indyref

Aren't we lucky to live in a democratic country? #indyref

#indyref The referendum wasn't his choice; it was forced on him.

Not unexpected about #indyref. Next few years critical, though; if there's no real change the split will have been postponed, not avoided.

Can't believe we shat it in the end. Prepare yourselves for the poor to get poorer and the rich to get even richer. #indyref

It's a good result for #Wales , we can argue for parity with #Scottish devolved powers. #IndyRef

Everything pretty much stays the same then, so how much did all that cost the tax payer? #indyref

And in other news: BBC is expected to report on the discovery of massive oil fields off the West coast of the 'UK' later today. #indyref

Of course, the big question now is how did the #indyref impact house prices

Needed more than 140 to express how I feel #indyref #votedyes

Disappointed with #indyref result but proud of how we reached it. Lot's to do to make Scotland a fairer, better nation.

I'll always be proud to say I voted yes, even though my vote didn't matter, i'm proud to say I believed in my country #indyref

Regardless of however people voted. I'm proud that so may people took the time to actually participate on this monumentous day #indyref

Never mind Yes voters, you will always have rugby #indyref #RWC2015

I'm so proud of my country in how we've handled this important decision. Not going to lie, I'm delighted with the result #indyref

Sky News showing white balancing in action. #indyref

So proud to be Scottish today, we are not cowards but have simply spoken for what we want at this moment. #indyref

Oooh woke up in the same country as yesterday. Good.  #indyref

I am delighted that the Union remains. That is all I want to say on the matter. #indyref

#indyref and now a swift shift to the English question. Scotland already receding from conversations.

Set my alarm for 6am to watch the big moment in the #indyref. Think I missed it by a few minutes. Disappointed but great result nonetheless.

Scotland - Who's Yo Daddy? Oh, wait, it's David Cameron. #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

Fantastic news about 84% turnout in #indyref . Shows when something is really at stake voters will engage.

Here's to another 300+ year union with the Scots! #indyref

Now I am going to have the world's longest exhale. #indyref

Awaking glad of the NO vote. And great to see such a good turn out for the democratic process. #indyref

Sorry, haven't really been following does this mean Scotland hasn't made it through to the live shows? #indyref

I hope our Hibs friends are looking forward to union flag night at Ibrox ;-') #Indyref

The 1.5m who voted yes should be deported. #Scotland #indyref

Scotland said NO,Catalonia is next,I can predict a YES is likely win that one #Indyref

Another thing we've affirmed: the Tories are not a national party any more, as evidenced by their reliance on in #indyref.

Has the #indyref reignited English nationalism? Changes afoot I think, certainly not 'business as usual' #ScotlandDecides #bettertogether

Why was so many votes rejected surely it was easy enough to put an x in a box off your choice! #indyref

Outside, rain is coming down in sheets. Thunder is rolling. The sky is black. Winter is here. Scotland, what have you done? #indyref

Now for the big questions:will Alistair Darling keep the handle #indyref

Scundered for you Scotland. What a chance you had. How you've wasted it. #indyref

David Cameron says Alex Salmond and SNP will join talks on new powers for Scotland #indyref

Just woke up to the result. Maybe The Count was wrong #indyref

#indyref  I am somewhat tearful over the result Love Britain, Love Scotland!

Is it possible for over half a nation to suffer from Stockholm syndrome?  #indyref

Actually hate Scotland right now. Of course the result was no because of stupid people that were undecided voting no #indyref

Turnout surely the biggest story of #indyref. Incredible - so will it be a catalyst for engagement next year at the General Election?

Getting bored of the sob stories now #ManUp #indyref #ScotlandDecidesNo

Are those boot scrapers outside number 10? I can't think of a less muddy place than central London. #indyref

Scots vote yes! Cowards vote no! Well done Scotland! #indyref

Can we acknowledge that politicians didn't win/lose #indyref Yes/No? They contributed, with mostly ineffective campaigns, it was The People

Whatever the result. 84% voter turnout. Highest in British electoral history. Believing in a cause encourages participation. #indyref

#indyref Thanks Scotland for supporting the workers of England and Wales.

Apt quote about the place I live (can't call it country -it clearly is nothing but a region now) . #indyref

Very glad to have woken up to find my country is still intact : ) #indyref #nothanks Now time for more devolution  not just in #Scotland!

Independence handed to it on a plate. But not packaged and wrapped up just as neatly and perfectly as they'd like? 'No thanks' #indyref

All eyes on now. Clegg can't  Cameron *won't* deliver change. This is chance to make a better #Britain. #indyref

Biggest lesson for Labour is that kowtowing to the neoliberal project hollowing out its support. #indyref shows demand 4 social justice

Well the Union Jack will remain as it is! I think it's great (great to be pronounced with the famous scottish accent) #indyref

Just under half of Scotland rejected you, Dave.  Will you  your pedigree chums be a bit less cocky now? #indyref

NAW, I'm no a zombie, I'm no a shitebag, I'm no fuckin off to England either! I voted logically because I had NO answers! #VoteNo #indyref

Go go Scotland!!! (Not go as in leave, but go as in well done!) - glad you chose to stay #indyref

Dammit Scotland you scared us for a minute there #indyref

Combined with the quote this gives the impression might not accept the #indyref result gracefully!

David Cameron shouldn't be speaking, unless he's willing to take some of the blame for Scots' unhappiness. #indyref

but Scotland still needed to fight. Fight to make it work as it could never be handed over perfectly. No stomach for the fight #indyref

Have to say, I'm delighted waking up to the news that Scotland will still be part of Great Britain. #indyref

David Cameron: Now the debate has been settled for a generation there can be no disputes, no reruns #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I'd hate to think that 55% of voters are happy with the status quo of food banks, bedroom tax, and destruction of NHS. #indyref

Aberdeen voted no. That's Aberdeen. The tartan oil place. With the oil brains. They said no #indyref

What we have learned from this vote is that nearly half of Scotland hate us! #indyref

'We have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.' PM Cameron quite forceful on notion of no referendum reruns down the track #indyref

I'm spellbound by this Scotland #indyref. So rare to see raw, unadulterated democracy in action. 86% voted: 'yes' or 'no'. That's it.

Together, the #UK can strengthen the economy,create more jobs and boost growth - link to Chris Cummings' statement shortly #indyref #fs

Hi how's your day today #nothanks #indyref

How's that jacket holding out what you up to today ? #indyref

NOW HE'S GOING TO FUCK ALL YOUR HOLES WITH HIS GROTESQUE LIZARD COCK #indyref

Looking forward to the promised change from #Westminster after #indyref they need to follow through to avoid serious backlash

So scotland has decided #gutted hopefully and cant express this enough onwards and upwards #indyref

so if you have an opinion on anything worldwide you must live there for it to be valid? #indyref

Moving on, then. Rydhsys rag Kernow lemmyn! #indyref

So, Cameron's heart isn't broken. Still, there's always May 2015. #indyref

I wanted to do a lesson on Scotland today, unfortunately I'm not independent enough as a trainee. Been told it's UK only. #indyref #PGCELife

The worst thing about the #indyref is that the Tories will now act like they've saved the planet from certain destruction #moveon

It's been incredible to see this level of democracy in Scotland. An example for the world of peaceful self determination. #indyref

I think I'd now like to see an apolitical Independence Club/Society in every Scottish town and village, throughout the country. #Indyref

Cameron promises new powers to Scotland? Yeah, do what you like with less money, lads. #indyref

UK PM: Scottish independence has been settled for a generation. No re-runs #indyref

Headline suggestion #indyref: Salmond Eats Crow

The PM the three pro union parties will ensure commitments made before vote will be kept #Indyref

And now, Britain, show the rest of Europe what real reform looks like. #indyref #BetterTogether #ScotlandDecides

A good decision. Now let's all simmer the eff down and start pretending to like each other. #indyref

Ironically, it looks like we got off Scot-free. #indyref

God I hate being on the same side as David Cameron. What a bellend. #indyref

So it's #No from Scotland #indyref but what next? They'll have more powers so Wales and NI will be looking to have their own battle next..

So Scotland has voted 'No' and we're stuck with them for now. Time for England to have a vote as to whether we want them now #indyref

Now politicians need to think big enough to encourage an 80% turnout in all elections. That is how we get true democracy #indyref

I knew it was unlikely to happen #indyref but I didn't expect to feel so heartbroken

Bigger say Proportional representation would be a start #indyref

I just want the official #indyref results. Where's the #Highland declaration? #ScotlandDecides #sleepy #workisgonnasuck

Tory boys in SE sobbing into their Eggs Benedict right now, distraught at not jettisoning-off the welfare-sapping Scottish scum. #indyref

David Cameron: A new and fair settlement for Scotland should apply to all parts of the UK. #indyref

But Cameron still has to resign, right? #indyref

David Cameron: 'I am delighted. It would have broken my heart to see the UK come to an end' #indyref

David Cameron's make-up is good this morning! #indyref

We may be Scotland the PROUD but we sure as hell ain't Scotland the BRAVE today.  #indyref  #YesScotland  #shame

A weight has lifted off my shoulders, truly. I love this country, all of it, and exactly the way it is. #IndyRef

Cameron promises devolution commitments will be met, with extra powers on taxspend settled by november #indyref #breaking

At 06:08 this morning Scotland voted to maintain the union #indyref giving his statement now

Ok, we've heard from Darling and Cameron, still waiting for the real winner of the #indyref : John Terry

So it's all over. Now up to the politicians to deliver those unspecified promises they made. I'll not hold my breath.  #indyref

Cameron says there is to be a comprehensive solution to the West Lothian question at same pace as Devolution #indyref

Oh my giddy aunt.English votes for English laws. #indyref #federalism #HomeRule

I was NO in 79  came to regret my mistake. Hope NO voters in 14 don't feel the same. An' forward tho I canna see I guess an fear. #indyref

#indyref #Scotland Am proud of the fact that we had such a huge turnout 80% of voters placed a vote.Highest turnout ever #proudtobescottish

Media gather to watch statement from British PM David Cameron #indyref

I'm disappointed that nobody tweeted, 'Well that answers the West Lothian question', after they declared. #IndyRef

I will always remember today as the day the scottish people knelt to the queen. #scotlandnolongerexists #indyref

West Lothian question to be resolved says David Cameron. #indyref #indyts

Phew! #indyref (My tiny brain couldn't comprehend all the ways things would change after a Yes vote)

Less than two hours to go and I've hit the wall. Will be bringing you all the reaction to #indyref here until 9am:

I know I should tweet something profound re the union and the #indyref but I'm struggling to do anything since loading #iOS8 #DontDoIt #slow

#British  PM Cameron: Draft laws to give #Scotland more  powers to be published by January   #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Would've felt quite funny going to office in London today, feeling more British than Scottish colleagues had #indyref result gone other way

Vernon Bogdanor on - referendum has 'probably awakened the slumbering beast of English nationalism' #indyref

Seeing all these no voters jumping about celebrating is baffling I don't get it, nothing changes, hardly worth the excitement #indyref

Did call me Dave just suggest a devolved England? #indyref

The people have voted. You cannot argue the result, wether you are happy or not. I however, I am very relieved #indyref

What could new powers for Scotland AND England mean for business  exporting more? #GetExporting #indyref

PM: We have heard the voice of Scotland, and now the million voices of England must be heard. English votes for English laws. #indyref

The Africans for Yes chap was catching 40 winks during a quiet period of the count  many photographers took his photo as he slept#indyref

We are fortunate to be able to set-up these issues at the Ballot Box. #indyref

Just woken the children with the #indyref news. They are all relieved. So am I.

Talisker 10yr tonight. Well, this afternoon, anyway. #indyref

Salmond speech-fail, Darling speech-fail, waiting for Cameron now. Did none of them get the memo? It's Intl Talk Like A Pirate Day #indyref

Fun fact:  Scotland's national animal is the Unicorn. An animal which doesn't exist  Much like their independence. #indyref #UKForLife

We didn't block the decision,We have heard the settled will of the ScottishPeople,those who voted 4 independence we hear U-Cameron #indyref

Must build a better future for our entire United Kingdom #indyref #HomeRule

Feeling thrilled right now the people of Scotland have made the right choice god bless Gordon Brown deserves a knighthood #indyref #Thankyou

The UK survives as Scotland votes No to independence  via #indyref

Scotland has Voted No to Independence - Bubblews  via #indyref #Scotland

Did someone punch Cameron in the face, looks like he has two black eyes. #ScottishReferendum #indyref #ScotlandDecides #scottishindependence

Shame.  I was looking forward to seeing Edinburgh renamed Salmondgrad #indyref

Well done David Cameron for raising the West Lothian question! English votes for English laws #indyref

Well that's good because, you know, I really like Irn-Bru. #indyref

David Cameron has announced that trousers are now mandatory in Scotland #breakingnews #cnn #Scotland #scottishindependence #indyref

The results of the Scotland #indyref will (hopefully) prevent the Balkanization of Europe.

Ending with 'Good morning' has always seemed weird, he made it weirder #indyref

They were never going to leave, they were just treating us mean to keep us keen #indyref

What is new is what he is saying about England #indyref

David Cameron confirming that Scotland has sold itself short yet sgain#indyref #shitebags

I really hope that all grab this opportunity to change the way we work in the United Kingdom. #indyref

Can we start talking about cool things now? Like, what's the best sandwich or who would win in a fight, a clown or a moose? #IndyRef

Disappointing that the Prime Minister didn't mention #votesat16 in his speech - you can't ignore us!  #indyref

Happy #reunion day! Let's celebrate what we have in common and work together for a better Scotland and UK #indyref

UK PM says discussion on increasing powers to Scotland must be accompanied by similar talks for English, Welsh, N Irish voters #indyref

Pragmatism and multicultural multinationalism won the day #indyref

Be nice if result of #indyref was about union  solidarity rather than  cowardice  self interest, but don't think that's how voting works.

Time for Westminster to step up  deliver on their promises. If they fail let's get ready for #indyrefthesequel #indyref

So stimmte Schottland ab - feine  #indyref

Cameron lays a trap for Miliband on parallel powers for England. #bbcindyref #indyref

Good call Scotland, good call. #indyref #VoteNo

was honestly expecting a 'yes' win through #indyref

Yah, but a pub brawl is more fun. MT Cameron: Ppl can settle these matters peacefully at the ballot box #IndyRef #Scotland

Well done Scotland. Time for Westminster to buck up their ideas and remember its peoples on the other sides of the border #indyref

That was what Alex Salmond wanted all along.   Like a wife telling her husband she'll leave if he doesn't pay her more attention #indyref

Bookmakers 1 Social Media Tools 0 #indyref

Looks like The UK will become a federal state. Cameron also hinting at more City Mayors #indyref

you had your moment. Now please fuck off #indyref

Dear Scotland, we knew you loved us really, thanks for sticking about #indyref #Scotland

People are saying 'we've made the right decision' but how can you possibly know at the moment. Only time will tell #indyref

Time for Scotland to come together and move towards a united Scotland and respect the decision made by the Scottish people #indyref

That'll be Yes and the SNP sent homeward to think again #indyref

Well that's enough disappointment for one day #indyref

I agree with Cameron, no matter what you voted for, all Scots are part of the UK and all shall be heard, here's to unity #indyref

Real result of #indyref? I'm up a few quid. Would have been more but for a low turnout in Glasgow  an unexpectedly high NO vote in Orkney.

#indyref - looks like rest of the world reckons we are #bettertogether too pound vs dollar

Do people in Wales not have voices worth hearing, Mr Cameron? #indyref

Well done Scotland. It's now time for England to get a fair deal. #indyref

It took 9 hours to count the votes, but Scotland has chosen to remain part of Britain. A big Texas-sized cheers from Austin, y'all! #indyref

Scotland has voted no in the #indyref. Would this be a good time to ask for a fair deal for #Derbyshire now? Not a #revolution but

Thank you #Scotland. Together we are stronger. #indyref

Devolved powers for all four nations. Welcome to the prologue of a whole new UK. #IndyRef

Depressing: Scotland votes No to independenceThe latest #indyref news, reaction and analysis

SoThe first act of an emboldened England will be to vote Judy Murray off Strictly then? #indyref

Win-win for Cameron - keeps UK together but also set to increase powers in England by answering West Lothian question. #indyref

I am waiting for Bowie to speak #indyref

Twitter is full of many more No voters than it was yesterday. Funny how that happens. #indyref #bettertogether

I heard white wine vinegar is great for getting Yes stickers off your windows. #indyref

1km in the pool. Now, more devolved powers for England, please. #indyref

Biggest legacy of the #indyref - the founding of the United States of the UK?

The real victory in Scotland's #indyref is the voter turnout of over 84%. I hope we all continue to be engaged no matter how we voted.

Ireland's government have advised Scottish gov in wake of #no vote to 'ask again in two years' #indyref

I'm not checking, but how many 'Scotland the (not-so) Brave' jokes are circulating on Twitter at this moment? #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Off to work very relieved that I am still part of the UK. Scotland makes Britain GREAT. #indyref Bring on May 15. #toriesout

Appealing epilogue of redemption being quickly added to new prints of Gordon Brown biography#indyref

New years honours. MBE for Salmond. That will confuse him #indyref

Seems some yes voters are struggling to grasp the idea of a democratic vote #indyref

Wow. What David Cameron just said. The West Lothian question answered by WHEN?!?!?! #indyref #r4today

Relieved with #IndyRef but hope Eng, Ire'd and Wales haven't paid too high a price: King Alex mustn't charge us for Welfare boost up North.

Oh Highland please hurry up!! #indyref

Post #IndyRef, PM lays out promise for greater powers for Scotland  rest of UK. Great opportunity for Manchester. Stop talking/start doing.

I didn't know Cameron had a heart to break #indyref

Democracy is the real winner today! #OurUnitedKingdom showing the rest of the world how it's done. Deeply proud of our country! #indyref

No truth in the suggestion that they'll fire off an #indyref celebratory Trident firework.

no cheap weekends over for us irish so #devastated #indyref

Gutted. Can't understand how 55% of people can reject their own independepence. #indyref

I'd also like to thank Scotland for reminding Westminster hacks of street politics. Profane, passionate,  more real. #indyref

Whilst delighted Scotland have stayed with the UK am gutted Cameron still PM. #Indyref highlight he is an inept politician.

Now I want a vote to see if Scotland should be allowed to stay #indyref #wasteofmoney

Wow. Scotland is no, devolution is yes? Change is afoot, let's hope our politicians see it through #indyref #manchester

The 6 nations just got a lot less interesting #indyref

Phew well glad that's over. Now let's all work together to continue to drive for change in Scotland. Yes voters that means you too #indyref

And that crazy thunder and lightening last night, was that some appropriately dramatic weather for the #indyref or what?

No: 1,914,187 votes (55.4%). Yes: 1,539,920 (44.6%). Turn-out 84.48%, which is a British record. #indyref

How come only the Scots got to vote for indy music? I demand more Primal Scream for England, Wales  Northern Ireland. #indyref

Help me decide: Has there been any damage to Scotland as a result of the independence referendum? #tricider #indyref

Well done Scotland! What a massive waste of time that was! #indyref

So Sean Connery still can't return #unlucky #indyref

Thrilled by #indyref result, but all feels a bit like a stroppy teen (snp) being told no,  then having their pocket money doubled anyway!

Delighted to be able to still tick #british on questionnaires and forms #indyref

Lets all take a moment to reflect on the poor company who had won the contract to rebuild Hadrians Wall #IndyRef

Common sense prevailed #indyref and we remain a united Kingdom still

In times of osterity, why make government more complicated and more expensive? #indyref

Scotland votes No. Here are the historic front pages we are waking up to in the UK #indyref

Back in bed now, catching up on the #indyref

That'll be the baw burst then. Hopefully 2 mill that disagreed know something I don't.Congrats. its been emotional. #indyref #nohardfeelings

Really hope this doesn't radicalise Oor Wullie. #indyref

#Scotland is great. Scotland's even greater within union. But it's a warning to the politicians  their cronies. #indyref

Now the 65 million English people should be considered with the same weight as the 5 million Scottish people #indyref

Difficult to see how votes at 16 could be opposed given how responsible and informed they have been for #indyref

The pound hits a 2 year high against the Euro as referendum results come in. #indyref #ScotDecides

English devolution would surely give the Tories a majority over English decision making? #indyref

Apparently Alex Salmond has been spotted boarding a plane at Edinburgh Airport bound for Eastern Ukraine #indyref

West Lothian Q. Peter Hennessy says we need to be cautious about change. We've been discussing this since 1977. Where's he been? #indyref

Glad to see the majority of people living in Scotland still have their marbles. #indyref

and now Farage is back on the radio. Uugh #indyref

Rumours are rife that SNP are developing #indyref sequel - Scottish Independence 2: Salmond Protocol

Well, as would say: what's next? #indyref #votedyes

The four Yes voting local authorities have the highest levels of poverty.. #indyref

Who feels a bit gutted to hear #No for the #indyref ?

Irrespective of the result the #indyref has got people talking about politics. That's how change happens.

Realised I unconsciously dressed in scot colours, so consciously phucked off red lipstick. #indyref

#ScotlandDecides #indyref Disappointing day for some but what a campaign it's been! Scots passion for change will be remembered for years!!

I'm more glad of the fact that the result must really piss Andy Murray right off. #ScottishReferendum #indyref

Hope there are still opportunities to discuss devolution of powers to other non-London regions in the UK #IndyRef

Not on my soapbox this morning, but something tells me the UK is a better place today now politicians need to deliver results #indyref

Absolute joke that Scotland haven't gone independent!!! no voters be ashamed falling for campaign with nothing but scare tactics #indyref

Dear Scotland, I'm glad you decided to stay, it would've been lonely without you #indyref #ScotlandDecides

One clear question - yes or no has now led to thousands of others with no clear answers! #ScotlandDecides #indyref

Oh well a cowardly country who seem happy to have whatever government or coalition middle England decide to elect #disappointed  #indyref

No real shock in the result but the most powerful stat is the 80% participation. Seems like head and ruled heart #indyref

Now this is all over, I hope to see less salmond and darling on my telly box #indyref

Result! Happy interdependence day. Now let's all have a group hug and work together to make this country even more awesome :) #indyref

OK, #Twitter, you can stop now. Get some sleep. #indyref

I hope this has not spurred on the Welsh into thinking they should have a referendum. 2 years of them whining on would be painful #indyref

Scottish #indyref over. Now DC confirms it's time for the English #indyref to take place.

No we're together its time for change! People should not let that energy go to waste stay involved!!!! #indyref

Whilst Westminster is made up of out of touch elitist body of people (all parties) , there will continue to be many disenfranchised #indyref

Woke up to a no vote #indyref..now to follow another round of discussions and debates on devolved powers

Fantastic #indyref turnout yesterday. Let's not ignore people's passion for shaping the future of the country #ConstitutionalConvention

We've only just begun. The #indyref was a much-needed reminder that it is absolutely within our reach to control our own destiny.

#Indyref now lets see Rangers and Celtic in the Premier League.

Today thousands of scots this morning wake up to a Scotland that has voted to remain together with the rest of the UK family! #indyref

David Cameron - why do you keep calling The UK a Country!? We are 4 CountriesWales, Scotland, Ireland and Scotland. Wirdduw. #indyref

Gordon Brown is the star of this campaign. His momentous speech will go down in history. #IVotedNo #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I hope David Cameron phones Gordon Brown this morning to say 'Thank you for saving my ass' #indyref

Main thing from #indyref  is that enough people showed passion to vote to voice their opinion. Hope this is echoed in general election

Sad to see self righteous tweets from some of the No camp. A gracious victory would be more dignified when almost half voted Yes #indyref

These supposed extra powers are a fucking laugh. They know they can do anything they want to them jocks so why would they give them #indyref

#DobsRidiculosity I knew Scotland would say no. #Indyref

Glad to see union is still in place. Now wondering how UK politicians are going to deliver fair system for all parts of the UK #indyref

I suppose this mornings news means I can wear these bad boys #scotland #indyref #britain

Hear English voices here ALL the time. They've suddenly made Scottish #indyref an English issue.That's the point!

The Sun's campaign ratings of #indyref players: Salmond 8/10, Murphy 7, Darling 6, Farage 5, Cameron 4, Alexander 3, Clegg 2, Miliband 1

The UK need turnouts like this for general elections as together we can speak out clearly #IndyRef #scotlanddecides

#indyref thank goodness that is all over, can now be proud of #teamscotland again (after that phrase was stolen by soapy)

Love that Fife brought home the vote! Feel privileged that mine was one of the 139,788 #indyref

Gullible scotland actually votes tory #indyref

Farage as the anti- Peter Henneseywisdom of the saloon bar #indyref #r4

Scotland #indyref via #inthreewords  - Scotland has decided.

The SNP missed a trick. They should have offered a can of Tennents Super for every YES vote. YES 100% NO 0% #indyref

David Cameron has spoken to Alex Salmond and said nah-nah, nah, nah-nah #indyref

Congratulations to #Scotland to this wise decision. #Europe can only be built of brick and not grains of sand! #indyref

Dear Scotland, you've been like a whiny little spoilt child on a car journey - now please do us all a favour and shut up #IndyRef

Pound rallies with stock market surge predicted after Scotland votes no  #indyref

Brilliant news to wake up to. The Union has been saved and the 'Yes' camp, so sure of victory have had their eye wiped #indyref

Happy Scotland voted no. We're stronger together but things must change. #indyref

Just woke up.can't believe Scotland shat itso embarrassing to be the only country to refuse independence #indyref

Assume the fat slimy wanker Alex Salmond is now going to find somewhere to fuck off and die quietly. #IndyRef

I'll guess I'm the only person on the office who was up at 0430 to watch the final results come in #indyref #fb

If the #indyref shows anything it's that people do turn out for elections when they feel they can actually affect an outcome

A victory for democracy. Great turnout that proves politics isn't dead in the UK when you have something meaningful to vote for. #indyref

Just so relieved but there will now be great turmoil and uncertainty. The Uk must be rebuilt on a new model. #indyref

Scotland votes No to end Salmond's #indyref dream  (PA)

Turns out I wanted a 'Yes' result. I didn't know that until I heard the news this morning. #IndyRef

Now the Scots bottled it, can we have a referendum to separate from them? #indyref

What happens in 2017 when England votes to leave the EU and Scotland votes to stay in? #indyref

How can people think Scotland was going to free to forge its own future when supremacy of EU law was to be their destination. #IndyRef

Seriously folk , it's bet to log off twitter for a while if you're just ranting. The amount of fury/backslapping is insufferable. #indyref

#indyref who believes they rigged the vote?  I do, there I no way that so many people actually  believed that crap about more powers. Oh boy

Glad to be waking up to a United Kingdom. Independence clearly rejected by the Scottish people. Need to move forward united as one. #indyref

So nothing has changed except there will not be another #indyref

I might not be British, but what a relief it is that Scotland will still be part of the glorious United Kingdom #indyref

#indyref I guess Scotland will be kissing Britians ass for 300 more years.Whatever happened to freedom and independence?

I would have thought a 45/55 % decision was quite close actually.  The experts don't seem to think the same.  Oh. #indyref #ScotDecides

#Labour supports having nonMuslims in the UK being treated like garbage.#UKIP  #LibLabCon #Indyref #UK #Tory

Looks like Alex Salmond has finally lost his smug, arrogant smile and been sent homeward to think again #indyref

It is not fair that everyone within the EU gets free tuition fees in Scotland other than the English, Welsh and Northern Irish #indyref

it had more to do with #GordonBrown and #scaremongering than anything #Cameron did #indyref

Scotland, you bottled it you pussyoles! #indyref

#indyref hope a few million more people have got the 'voting bug' and will still have it at the next General Election.

Bitterly disappointed by you Scotland, you could have done so much better on your own. #indyref

#Indyref result a bigger problem for Tories. Have to give Devo Max as promised but now faces demands from English regions.

It was a tale of sense and sensibility and sensibility won. But big up to the dreamers #scotlanddecides #indyref

Cameron crowing about what's best for Scots. Lamont criticising Salmond's gracious in defeat speech. Neither won the election. #indyref

Everyone laying into David Cameron this morning, you do realise he didn't have any say over the outcome, don't you? #indyref

Dundee I could fucking kiss you. #IndyRef #YES

The turnouts have been amazing - no question when all the results are in that the majority have spoken. #IndyRef

This is democracy. No little green men on holiday, no violence. Just arguments. I'm proud of Europe. Congrats, #Scotland. #indyref

Looks like England won't have to grow up Amy time soon. Rule Britannia! #indyref.

It will be ironic if #indyref #No vote actually means an English parliament and more rights for #England

My feed has suddenly turned into Middle Earth #indyref

Truism confirmed by this #indyref: never bet against Nate Silver.

David Camron walks downstairs for breakfast #indyref

Someone best cancel them builders on their up way to rebuild Hadrians Wall now the Jocks are staying put. #indyref

I'd hate to be Alex Salmond right now. It's bad enough that Scotland voted no, but having to go and speak to that smug fuck Cameron #indyref

Hopefully the result will show parliament that urgent change is needed to help the poor not just in Scotland but all over the UK #indyref

Scotland votes no - but what next? Listen to analysis from Alistair Jones on breakfast show #indyref

R Scotland has rejected independence, #indyref results confirm

I really wish it had been yes #indyref

Flag manufacturers across the world are groaning this morning. #indyref #saltirestays

Not angry. Not bitter. Not dismayed. Just sad. Now we'll never know. #indyref

If Westminster is handing out powers I'd like to be able to fly but would accept fully equipped bat cave as a compromise #indyref

Being ruled by another country IS NOT DEMOCRACY #indyref

David Cameron succeeded in convincing Scotland to vote for 100% of income tax. That's the bottom line for the NO vote. #indyref #Scotland

Oh god Now Cameron is trying to use the #indyref result to push his own agenda in England #newbattles

If Dev had run the Yes campaign he'd now be planning to murder Gordon Brown #indyref

It's understandable, but #indyref has suppressed other stoies. Else you wud have been talking about #Alibaba

#indyref bet #andymurray has cramp and a bad back this morning ..

Poor you - you may have to do lods of answering next summer -:) #indyref

great news #indyref and lovely sunrise photo John

I'm worried about Highland. It'll be dark soon and we still haven't heard from them. #indyref

Enhance your morning by reading furious disappointment at the #indyref result.

This is what Scotland's largest city looks like after a national turnout of 86% for #indyref #Glasgow #calm #changed

Mrs Overall ON/ Oh, I am pleased #indyref

Scotland says NO #indyref.. Let's move along now.

Hahar! Yer mutiny failed, now get back below decks! You're stuck with the same lousy captain as the rest of us. #TalkLikeAPirateDay #indyref

Yes voters shouldn't be disappointed though, this is a major step towards getting more devolved powers #indyref

I'm proud to say I'm one of many who campaigned for equality while others cowered. Doesn't end here though, SCOTLAND WILL BE FREE #indyref

Well thank goodness that's all over with. Next drama - general elections #IndyRef

Cameron is going to be as smug as fuck now though #indyref

And here's the final result from #indyref as displayed by our colleagues at

Please please show a clip of Robin Easton drowning his sorrows in a pint of schloer #Scotland #indyref

It's actually unfortunate for Scotland not being able to seize the moment. #indyref

Well done Scotland and more importantly well done democracy. The rest of the world should take note! #indyref #bettertogether #Scotland

More importantly, isn't Huw Edwards tired? #indyref

Having shat their own breeks they've settled for wearing somebody else's.#indyref

and I wasn't too far off with my prediction on Wed that 54pc would voto no, was I?!  #indyref

It's times like this I wish I had a breakfast radio show, or any radio show :-( #indyref

is just not man enough to thank Gordon Brown #indyref #ShareTheFacts #Conservatives

Wearing my #bettertogether sweater. The blue is for you Scotland, glad you voted to stick around! #indyref

Whatever the thoughts on the #indyref its a great day for democracy. God bless the United Kingdom!

Incidentally, wouldn't it be something if the general election could replicate a turnout of 84% #indyref

Alex Salmond is the true winner, writes  #IndyRef #RedBox

Scotland! Land of the brave!..pfft! Scotland!  Land of the moan about the government, then offered chance to change naw its fine #indyref

#Indyref Thanks #Scotland for an exciting, well run, democratic process -  for putting constitutional reform back on the islands' agenda

#indyref reason prevails over empty promises.

Your not going, your not going, your not going anywhere #yesno #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Lets united to wipe out the blight of #redTories from Scotland forever #indyref

Now that we have got a no vote we are just going to get ripped off as usual, all our oil money will go to London again #indyref

Doubt 'promised reforms' much of a factor for votes either side. Not when the Scot govt doesn't use all existing tax powers anyway #indyref

BTW - think it's trite to say Scotland rejected independence They rejected leaving UK, a different thing for a proud great nation #indyref

DalaiLama Not finding something does not mean that it doesn't exist It only proves that the experiment was incapable of finding it #indyref

Proud of Scotland - finally real democracy in action #indyref Hope the momentum changes British politics forever.

Right enough #indyref Who's got the Tin Cup winner? #drawschmaw

I'm now sitting in my first lecture and slowly realizing that it probably wasn't a good idea to watch the whole of #indyref. #tired

Even this no vote has far reaching implications not just for the rest of the UK but potentially globally too #indyref

#indyref Ah, I thought you were still holding your breath waiting. ;-)

What am I going to do with all my smackaroonies ?#indyref #ScotlandDecides

Wake up to see Scotland vote NO!Someone keep the sharp things out of Alex Salmond's reach #indyref

the no's won, keeping the blue in the flag#IndyRef

Just can't shake the gutting feeling that after all the hype for the #indyref only 45% of voters had faith in their own country. #shocked

Scotland are now that 40 year old guy who stays with his parents and sleeps in a Spider-man bed. #indyref

All I can say after last nights events is Good luck Andy Murray's Marketing/PR team, rather you than me! #indyref #andymurray

Media conspiracy re #IndyRef. Murdoch was pro-independence. Errr #Kopites

You can unclench your buttocks now. ALL Scots now fully expect you to follow through. #indyref

Relief on the result. We will look back and see that the Scots achieved positive change for all of us in the UK today. #indyref

Anyway, enough of this #indyref bollocks, who's going to win the #BriscaF1 world final tomorrow?

#Scotland #indyref so the votes are counted. What now ? National day of celebration!!!! #bettertogether

On dear now Mr Farage has taken to the BBC, Hope isn't tired and can tear him a new one. #indyref

And so it begins!! A former BBC governor, will oversee the implementation of more devolution on tax, spending and welfare. #indyref

Morning.Woken at 6am by my 9 yr old daughter, desperate to know the #indyref result. Still avidly watching. Youth + democracy = .hope

So Cameron has blagged a result on #indyref I suspect #No are going wholesale disappointed when reality hits. #Nevertrustatory

Thank you radio four for understanding that I want to hear Geri Halliwell's tweets on #indyref alongside the political commentary

Well done Scotland, you won't regret it. Now come over here and give us a big hug! #indyref

Positives in defeat. 1) democracy's great. 2) voting age must be 16. 3) Remember Miliband? Utterly useless. Penny may now drop. #indyref

What did David Cameron have for breakfast? #SmokedSalmond #indyref #BetterTogether #ScotlandDecides

This is like when Will Young beat Gareth Gates all over again #indyref

Can't say I'm too fussed about Balamorey staying though #indyref #ScotlandDecides

You've got to hope this whole #indyref debate reignites scottish politics  stops everyone being so apathetic about it. No more 40% turnouts

Not sure how I feel about #indyref result, but I do hope the turnout, the engagement  the questions shake things up for the UK as a whole.

I can't think of anyone LESS relevant to the #indyref than Nigel Farage, #BBC. Except Kaiser Wilhelm II, perhaps. But he's dead. STOP IT.

Well, at least now that #indyref is over, we can stop all the bitter infighting and recrimi*Looks at Twitter*Ah.

What if Wales want to bin the uk? #indyref I'd actually vote!

Seems 2 million of us were incapable of arriving at our own decision. some bad man said boo #indyref

It's kind of ironic watching Labour celebrate the fact that nothing will change.  #indyref

I felt a great disturbance in the Force #scotland #indyref

do not blame the people who cared enough to cast their vote albeit different from your own. blame those who opted out #indyref

As someone who knows only a few things about #Scotland, I do find it funny that 60% of Stirling voted no in the #indyref. #history #irony

Westminster may have Big Ben, but we have all the time in the world. Be patient, we will return #indyref #ScotDecides #YesScotland

Cameron watches impassively as his missiles strike Scottish targets. Reaching into a glass tank, he grabs a live rat and eats it. #indyref

Can't deal with these two cunts on the TV this early in the morning. #indyref #bbcbreakfast

Both overjoyed and gutted for the people of Scotland. Hope our country can now repair the rift that has been created. #indyref

It feels like we we had diamonds in our grasp but swapped them for some magic beans #indyref

Cameron: Proposals for more devolved powers in England, Wales, Scotland  NI will be worked on #IndyRef

Glad to wake up this morning to find the NO campaign won the election #BetterTogether #indyref

Scotland has spoken, and Scotland has chosen to vote no for independence. The cries for change are very clear however #indyref #OneScotland

I do hope this sparks change for the people of #Scotland - They've most certainly had their voices heard! #indyref

Proud 2have stood with 1.6m indy supporters in Scotland. Campaign 4indy has only just started. Further devo is another step #indyref #chinup

Fact over fantasy, pride over prejudice, sanity over insanity, economics over eejitism, patriotism over parochialism! #indyref #commnsense!

Probably need to change the lyrics to Flower of Scotland now #IndyRef #Disappointed

It's an historic and critical achievement to keep the union together - congratulations and thank you #indyref

Why the fuck is Nigel Farage being interviewed on BBC about the referendum? #indyref

At least there's one thing that's new: Eddie Izzard has finally been involved in a campaign that didn't end in utter humiliation. #indyref

My goodness it was bloody close though #indyref

Tiny part of my soul died at realisation I agree with Farage on something. There MUST be a constitutional convention #indyref #HomeRule

Hopefully those of us who couldn't vote in #indyref will never take our right to vote for granted again

#indyref  Great news that we still live in a United Kingdom. Time for far more devolved power for the rest of the UK.

So the vote is no, have to say I'm suprised. #indyref

So the referendum fall out begins, and it's not pretty.#indyref #actwithdignity #weareinthistogether

If you want to see how a lot of us Scots feel about #indyref check out

The bit that impresses me: over 80% turnout for the vote. Imagine the question that would do that in England #indyref

Meaningful correlation? Yes result (Glasgow, N Lanark, Dundee) and workless benefits. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

UK's historic day: Scotland says 'no' #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Nigel Farage? He didn't get much air time leading up to the #indyref vote. Could you try to keep it that way in the future?

Gutted #votedyes #VoteYesScotland #indyref  been told to take losing gracefully, we've not lost a race! Our country's just been thrown away!

Please God Westminster, don't disappoint. Take the opportunity to put in some real change.It's your turn to seize the day!#indyref

#indyref Now that Scotland has 'spoken', can England now speak? Maybe we don't want new powers for Scotland.

Very disappointed by Scott's decision : they lost a chance to deliver both themselves  Europe from the Tories' economic madness. #indyref

Seeing just how many votes the 'yes' campaign managed to round up, I'm glad there wasn't a third question to break up the 'no' in 2 #indyref

great news for you I guess, seeing how biased your reporting has been. #indyref

It's not looking good for old Judy Murray on #strictly is it? #indyref

Well done  #AlexSalmond you fail to break the Union but succeed in ripping apart Scotland #indyref

Now more than ever, Scottish people deserve the truth about North Sea oil and gas  #indyref

But, like all politician's promises, I'll believe it when I see it #indyref

You know it's a good morning when you wake up and Britain is still Great #indyref #Scotland #ScotlandDecides #greatbritain #uk

at least this time the majority of scots got what they voted for. Unlike 2011 #SCOTLANDSAIDNO #indyref

On the plus side alex salmonnd does get to keep the pound after all! #indyref

Hope all you no voters enjoy your new and fairer settlement. #indyref #bendover

First Minister Alex Salmond: 'We will go forward as one nation' | News | Scotland Decides  #indyref

Before we act like we got away with it, remember 45% dissatisfaction against the status quo. There'll be another referendum #indyref

*what Alex Salmond was thinking when speaking to the whole of Scotland*. #indyref #scotland #independence #voteno

Tricky doing vox pop with voters who have been up all night *ahem* keenly considering the Barnett formula #stilldrunkatdawn #indyref

talking to on Saying #indyref opens up huge Qs for all #UK For once, I agree with him

David #Cameron's full speech following #BetterTogether victory:  #IndyRef #ScotlandDecides

Welcome back Scotland. :). It's like you never left. ;). Let's move forward as 1 now. #indyref

The only country to ever vote to reject independence does so out of fear and lies. Now Westminster will have its revenge. Sad day. #indyref

- You didn't miss anything Nigel.as bad as ever. Didn't have guts to take questions cos couldn't answer them! #Cameron #indyref

Feeling a little bummed out by the #indyref result. Imagine Norway still being in union with Sweden

but why is it a worse thing in principle than Scottish votes for Scottish issues? Practice is trickier #indyref

If UK in mood for major constitutional change, how about voting system that gives e.g. 18% of seats to party getting 18% of votes? #indyref

Scotland has voted 'No.'  How are my Scottish friends doing this morning..?  #indyref

I just cannot bear the smugness on the faces of Cameron  his henchmen #indyref

Scotland DO NOT go back in your box. #indyref

It is telling that even on the day that should be dominated by the #IndyRef result manages to frame Nigel Farage as a key figure

'Britain Breathes Again'  I'm not sure, but I think I was always breathing #indyref #GreatBritain

Scotland will remain a part of the UK, and we seem to have a Scottish civil war on our hands #IndyRef

It's take the piss out of the jocks day! #indyref

that is stamina! I'm on Sussex tea, showing my regional loyalties! #indyref

Democracy at work in Scotland. You can't say fairer than that. Salmond/Sturgeon win (lots if it's delivered) for Scotland anyway. #indyref

They should make today a bank holiday just for Scotland, actually make all week a bank holiday #indyref

Actually a bit disappointed #indyref Thought Scotland may have grabbed the chance when offered x

Something for wee to whiske along to on this beautiful morning:  #BetterTogether #indyref

Sounds like Scotland have the best of both worlds now. They didn't really want to leave the UK, did they #indyref #ScotlandDecides

told the world about #indyref from his kitchen! He will join us at 510pm to wrap the vote. Listen live:

That a was a huge victory for democracy, but an embarrassing defeat for Scotland. #IndyRef #NotBetterTogether

The working class voted #yes. Keep wearing your Yes badges with pride, today and every day. Let the nawbags see it and be ashamed. #indyref

Cameron's #indyref statement very well judged. For someone who does not vote Tory he is a pretty good statesman.

There is one Scottish great we have not yet heard from regarding Scotland's #indyref #Nessie

Delighted with the #indyref result  looking forward to everyone working together for a better UK #bettertogether

guarantee you tomorrow  youll see articles say vote count rigged #Indyref #Scotland, powers 2 b don't want free Scotland

William Hague intends to establish a committee that will reassure the 45% of Scots who voted for independence #indyref #ScotlandDecides

To the Scottish people hoping for another referendum in their lifetime most Glaswegians will be lucky to make Xmas  #indyref

Great Britain has won again! All hail the Union Jack! #BetterTogether #indyref #UKTogether

Congratulations Scotland. FULL FEDERALISM NOW #indyref  #ScotlandDecides

After a record breaking turnout for #indyref I expect a record low turnout for the next #GeneralElection cos I don't know who to vote for?

Sitting on my train fighting back tears after the outcome sinking in. I am a proud Scot but an extremely devastated one. #indyref

I wonder how many times the word reform will be used today it's a political term for more of the same #indyref

We remain a United Kindom, a knees up to mark our unity?#indyref

VOTE was NO ..  #Scotland this morning ..  a summary of today's #indyref developments

A momentous day which should be followed by magnanimity on both sides. Or. Say fuck it, its twitter and rage on. #indyref

Absolutely gutted! BBC now showing Scotland what they've to look forward too. Nigel Farage and David Cameron. Opportunity wasted #indyref

Scare tactics won, quel suprise #indyref

Scotland. Why? Really why do this to everyone who believed you breaking free is the solution to broken marriages? #indyref

In many many years to come no voters will realize that voting no was one their worse mistakes #indyref

Darling had an un-registered speaker #indyref

RT: The wins best front page today as #indyref editions hit newsstands   pic via

Good to know I won't need to apply for second passport #indyref Now Australia can breathe easy: little chance Tasmania can ask for vote now!

Scots have overlooked one crucial fact: the VOW was made by Gordon Brown! Do you remember the VOW he made for an EU referendum? #indyref

Scotland can pull together after #IndyRef and i hope that #Yes vote in #Glasgow  #Dundee highlights need for social change and investment

Stands Scotland where it did? Aye! #indyref Well sort of!!

Fell off my bike last night. Then Scotland votes No in #Indyref. What next? Plague? Locusts? Rivers run with blood?

Do we kiss and make up now? #indyref #ScotlandDecides

I agree with that which is why I would have blamed new labour  not had we lost #indyref

Sadder faces on the right.How do you see what's likely to happen moving forward?#indyref

You can tell just how much the yes voters in Glasgow  love their country by the filthy state they left the square #indyref #nothanks

I will still proudly wear my Yes badge. Because, yes, I still want a better country. #indyref #YesScotland

Incredible turnout for #indyref 86%! Brilliant that people still take politics seriously. Gutted Westminster's scaremongering worked though

Great analysis from  point 8 in particular v interesting#indyref #c4news

#leeds 20th celebration dinner and #indyref results - when did you sleep?!

Few years and it will prob happen again lets just hope no one regrets there votes #indyref #disappointed

Wow turnout of 84.5% for #indyref compared to 65.1% in last general election! #citizenship

Only country in history to vote against their independence, massive mistake #indyref

Maybe what we need to do to get Americans to care about elections enough to vote is to put secession on the ballot. #indyref

Westminster has to deliver this change through the devolution of power to not just Scotland but Wales, N.Ireland and England also. #indyref

Scotland has rejected independence, #indyref results confirm   cc

#indyref What a surprise? No 55% v Yes 45%. Time for fat boy Dave Cameron to renage on those 11th hour promises for the Scots dissenting

Incredibly high turn out for the vote - 84% I think. How can we keep these people engaged with politics. #indyref

45% of Scots will have woken up very pissed off with the other 55% - never a good thing. #indyref

Got a little emotional about the #indyref result. Thanks Scotland for sticking with us. Honour those promises Westminster!

common sense has prevailed big chap, big relief! Square sausage will always be on the menu. #squaresausage #indyref

14% that dint vote in #indyref can be broken down into 1 conscientious objectors 2 the completely disenfranchised  3 the couldn't be arsed

Scotland votes 'No' to independence Very happy at this result well done Scotland. #indyref

All-rounder Andrew Castle channeling the #AccidentalPartridge we all crave: plays Move Closer for Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron #indyref

So we have to go back to GMT after all then? #indyref

Turkish support for the Daash? Can't be true, can it??? #indyref #Kurds #ireland #gamechanger #USA

Sadly I haven't woken up in an independent country, but well done to all those who turned out to be counted on both sides! #indyref

Time to clock off. It's been a long but exhilarating night. #indyref

In pictures: Scotland votes to remain in the U.K.   #Indyref cc:

#indyref sorry mate, but who the fuck are you anyway? Do you even have a job? #IrrelevantCUNT

The hope v fear thing is a false distinction. You could apply both to both if you wanted to. It was simply Indy v Union. #indyref

Everyone seems to be going devolution nuts after #indyref Personally I just think every city should have a gay Prime Minister #DevoMaxiXXL

#indyref United we move forward to have a #onenation Labour Government in #GE15

It wasn't as close as I thought it would be #indyref

I do feel really proud of our nation (esp my in-law Scots) for dignity  non-violence w/ which whole #indyref has been conducted

NORTH AYRSHIRE: Yes 47,072 (49%)  NO 49,016 (51%) #ScotDecides #indyref  Wow. So close.

Are we sure the #indyref wasn't the World Cup first round? I distinctly remember this feeling when we got papped out of that as well. :(

England? Why are you Farage  nao? #indyref

#indyref #r4today Surely Salmond and side kick Sturgeon have to resign Their whole political ethos been given a resounding NO

85% turnout to vote. That's pretty darn admirable. Nice one Scotland #useyourvote #indyref

97% of the electorate registered to vote, 84% of those voted. And the winner isdemocracy. #ScotlandDecides #indyref

So is #indyref decided ultimately by the votes of those who are not Scottish?

The result may appear that #ScotlandDecides to be with #UnitedKingdom. May Scottish get their due share. Amen!#indyref

In pictures: Scotland votes to remain in the U.K.  #Indyref  via

Gutted, pure gutted. So close #Scotland so close. #indyref

Shall we vote his mother out of strictly? #indyref

Ive decided on my reaction 2 the #indyref result but it wud take more than 140 characters 2 sum up So: dont fuck this opportunity up England

Gerry Adams will be on  at 8.20am to discuss the Scottish Referendum result. #indyref

Could be worse this man could be the next U.K. Prime minister. Oh wait #indyref

Thank you for your resolute and passionate campaigning on behalf of let's see if they can deliver #indyref

I'm so ashamed as well our fellow rich scots once again in History ran for the hills left the poor in a BRUTAL world #indyref

are FINISHED. Scotland will never forgive, or forget this. #indyref

Ngl i know there aloud an opion but some celebs/sportpeople should keep a low profile about it IMO #indyref

Sorry guys I know everyone on here is gutted, hope your all doing ok. #indyref

Good morning world, you're looking bleary today #indyref #90minutessleep

#indyref This extra money doesnt go to Scots! It goes to Trident. If you want the money you can take Trident too!

So the sweaty socks bottled it. Now take your cheap prescriptions, free tuition fees and get outta here! #indyref

ITV going big on Geri Halliwell's reaction to #indyref - i'm off to work.

So  Scotland says No to independence  #ScotlandDecides #indyref  via

Ridiculous name of the day award goes to#biddlecombe #indyref #scotland #no

R #indyref turnout in Barra was approx 95%. Boxes have now departed by lifeboat to be counted in Lewis.

So happy #scotland has rejected independence. #lovetheunion #indyref A good day for the UK.

#VoteYesScotland #indyref ah! So where are the yes team heading to out of UK now? Probably Iraq Syria border to set up Scotland?

So Scotland voted, no. Half my family are still British, don't think they're very happy about that #indyref

Just 3 hours after decision confirmed it changed to what England needs. Where was all this rhetoric by MPs yesterday ? #indyref

I'm so embarrassed right now I actually just have no words #indyref

I am British 1st, English 2nd #indyref #rethink

More power for cities like #Manchester is now top of the agenda   #indyref

Wait a minute. What was the question again? #indyref

I feel truly sorry for anyone emotionally invested in the 'yes' camp. Another month and I think they might have made it. #indyref

Someone in BBC scheduling was pretty confident about the result in the #Indyref

already mention in news. as always Scotland leads this Union on the right path. #indyref

he is right but the consent is not universal any more with social media. And now many dont believe media at all. #indyref

103.8FM from 8:  on #indyref result, on  where in Dorset police front desks will close

Why Cameron and Miliband's #indyref campaign has left them weakened

Hopefully they'll get back in their box in Kiltshire now , sick of hearing from them ! #Indyref #EnglandsLargestCounty

A very good morning to our Scottish brethren. Now let's move on and be #bettertogether #indyref

Feel immensely proud of everyone who made their voice heard. Oddly, especially the YES in Dundee - you contrarian, odd little place #indyref

Sickened by peoples response. Grow up you're embarrassing our country #stophating #indyref

#indyref let's see how long this oil lasts now then!!

The 1st Boston Beer Festival Committee Meeting last night had the same outcome as the Scotland #indyref = #bittertogether

I'm feeling disappointed. Bit of an anticlimax, although I'm comforted by high voter  turn out.#indyref

Good on you Scotland! Great to see you're still with us. #indyref

#Scotland votes NO! Amazing news! We stay together. Relief! #indyref More power to Scotland, but fair play. Break up wasn't the answer. Ace!

Alex Salmond is the only one talking sense this morning #indyref

#Scotland lost the election but got what they wanted: The best of both worlds! Like spoiled children #indyref

Edinburgh were well in the no camp. You've always been my favourite, Ed. #indyref

We lost. But the struggle continues. Now, when isolation is tempting, movements  sticking together are especially important. #indyref

the results:  #indyref   the tangeable smell of relief from wGovt

Regardless of result it was amazing to see such strong turn out (85%!)  real passion. Just hope Westminster delivers on promises. #indyref

The big win is our combined country of the United Kingdom #indyref

Don't know which was more stressful. Waiting for #indyref results or breakfast in bed. Both arrived safely.

Excited about devolution across the Union. But don't rush constitutional change, Mr Cameron: that would be madness #indyref

In a change to scheduling, this morning's #BBCR4Today will end with and singing 'We're A Couple of Swells'. #indyref

Keep up with all the latest news, views and analysis as it happens:   #indyref

Gonna make me an english breakfast. #indyref

85% turnout in #indyref - Westminster political parties take note. It's not apathy, its just we think you're all greedy inbred prats.

Hope I'm wrong but I fear a whole new generation of Scots is about to experience what it's like to be fucked over by the #Tories. #indyref

#YesScotland #indyref the nightmare has been averted, time to realise the dream of a #betterfuturetogether #teamUK

Pleased that #Scotland chose #solidarity over #separatism Now let's all work together to build a better society #indyref #ThankGord

The Yes campaign should be proud, we had so much of the state machine against us, media bias, lies, bullying etc, 45%!!! Be proud. #indyref

Oh and when it comes to talk of 'extra powers' don't forget that Wales exists, too, #Westminster. I'll be watching you closely #indyref

When #AlastairDarling wins a popularity vote, the other guy must have really been a clown. Welcome back #Scotland #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Never mind the #indyref we're missing the real newsworthy story. on the iron throne

exactly. No idea who he's spoken 2 but only ppl impressed by #GordonBrown were south of border #indyref

anyone who believed The Vow shouldn't have been allowed to vote.1979 revisited.Btw have v much enjoyed your #indyref work. Thanks.

Bit disappointed, for a while it looked like something exciting might happen in British politics for the first time in a long time #indyref

84.5% turnout - that is something to celebrate for the whole nation #indyref
