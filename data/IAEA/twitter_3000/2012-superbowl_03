The #superbowl is always an amazing reminder of how absolutely fucking mental America is.

how does 46 total match points in #superbowl sound? fwiw I think Brady will win a 4th

Aw man. I wanted to hear Mitt Romney sing America the Beautiful at #superbowl #whoarethesepeople

Those earrings look like fly swatters! #Superbowl

I guess they didn't want to have people who could sing perform America the Beautiful at the #superbowl

Not even gonna lie, my favorite part of watching the #Superbowl is looking at all these butts!

Why am I even watching #superbOwl I don't even like American football. And I hate adverts in sport

Awww memory lane took me to my 1st NFL game & we saw Tom Brady! #Superbowl

Pretending to care about football one day a year is overrated. Go (insert team here)! #superbowl Cocktails instead.

What do we have for anthem lenght ? #Superbowl

Thank you #rmh for showing a baldy & representing kids with cancer. We #shave4brave to fight for them, too. #superbowl 46

As indifferent as I feel about this #superbowl, I do enjoy the pageantry and OTT melodrama of professional sports.

''if you talk during the Super Bowl it's like stabbing someone's wife'' #Superbowl

Be on the look out for my #SuperBowl Commercial you can't miss it..

#SuperBowl Bet: If Giants win, donate here--  & if Patriots win, donate here--  #teaparty #gop

Illuminati at the #SuperBowl there you all saw it don't ignore the sighs! They must be destroyed!!

I don't know the rules, everybody screams all the time and I don't know why #superbowl

when i was little i used to think #superbowl had something to do w/ cereal . .

For those who thought their Superbowl square numbers weren't good- Think again #safety #SB46

Intentional grounding from #tombrady results in safety for #giants. #superbowl

These commercials having me dying lmao #superbowl

I'm already over the #SuperBowl ads. Is it appropriate to watch Poirot during commercials?

Watching the #superbowl all alone, while I do my homework and play #templerun. I am such a loser.

Safety first score?! Who woulda thunk it #superbowl #NFL

Wow. A safety for NYG. NYG 2, Patriots 0 in 1st qtr.#superbowl

I've never seen a #SuperBowl start out with a safety

Football has to be the only thing that I can enjoy while only understanding 30% of what is happening. #SuperBowl

Classic Tom Brady getting a safety on his first play of the #SuperBowl

No sin talking curb ur enthusiasm while the #superbowl is firing away is there

I can't even pretend to know whats happening so thats it for me tonight. #SuperBowl

it's getting hot in here so take off all ur clothes #superbowl

Suddenly, everyone with a 2 square just got really excited.  #SuperBowl

That Pepsi MAX commercial where the guy is in an interview but flips out so his friend will get the job?  HILARIOUS.  #superbowl

omg never seen that!!! Unbelievable! 2-0 giants #SuperBowl

Over rated and most boring 'sport' going #SuperBowl

Hmmm, wonder what the odds were on the 1st scoring play being a safety? #Superbowl

Who is this girl singing in the commercial with Elton John? #SuperBowl #Pepsi

The only Twitter account worth following for #Superbowl updates is #advertising #media #nerd

Wow, how can you call that in the #Superbowl ? Damn Refs

Tom Brady WTF are you doing playing that safety #SuperBowl

rocked it. Have a fun and responsible #superbowl Sunday!

They somehow made Elton John gayer. Good job, Pepsi #superbowl

My goodness As long as I got a face, that Pepsi girl singing will ALWAYS have a place to sit! #SuperBowl

Wow!!!!! Safety??? however, 2 is one of my number in the #SuperBowl pool!

#superbowl Pepsi for all sucks balls 0 for 3

ha, a safety! wonder if anyone in the world had a bet on that! #superbowl

I'm starting to think Elton John is gay. #SuperBowl

Patriots need to pull out the win for me #Superbowl

Bailey is turning into his father, he just called grounding before the refs called it! Way to go kid! #superbowl

What where the #Vegasodds on that being the #firstplay of the #Superbowl?  A #Safety on the mighty #TomBrady ???   Game on!

Whoa. Everyone's #Superbowl pool just got thrown for a loop. #safety #NFL

Oh and American 'Football' is an awful sport #SuperBowl

are you boys watching the #superbowl? Who are you guys supporting! Please reply! :-) xxx

Me:doing #math homework sister&fiance:watching the #superbowl mom:cooking

#Superbowl I've picked my team, go on the Giants!

Nice work Brady, you pinhead! Safety baby! #SuperBowl

Somebody just committed a hate crime on Elton John #superbowl

Here comes Brady the man is a god #nohomo  did u jinx him?? Lol #superbowl

LOVE IT! Intentional grounding=safety. Who knew? #SuperBowl

ey who was that singin in the pepsi commercial? #SuperBowl

2-0 Giants! Got a safety when Brady threw that pass. Yes!  #superbowl

Giants with the first points on the board, I'd hate to have to Brady's bitch ass complaining right now #superbowl

SAFETY!!! FROM WHO??? That right Mr. can't do ANYTHING WRONG!!?? BAHHAAHHHAAAHH! #superbowl #bradynottheman

NBC found Giselle. There goes a prop bet. A safety for the first score. Amazing luck if you called those two. #SuperBowl

It's not bulimia if you're just making room for wingy-dingys. #superbowl

First scoring play is a safety!! NYG pass rush got Brady on his bottom from Pats first play. Giants 2-0 #superbowl

Looks like Giants putting the beat down early #Superbowl,

All the players & the crowd at the #superbowl should break into 'shipoopi' & dance. :) #familyguyreference

Wtf intentional grounding in the end zone, damn, not a great way to start the game. #SuperBowl #patriots

Wow, an iPad 2 commercial from last year. Thanks, CTV #SuperBowl

My 8 year old just asked me who Madonna is??! I told him she's the original Lady Gaga! Can't wait for halftime xo #superbowl

I jus watch da #Superbowl 4 da commercials lmao

What a horrible day to be sunny in #tofino. I can't decide on #superbowl, sleep or beach walk. Oh the dilemmas!

#SuperBowl #giants 2-0 Giants take the lead LET'S GO!!!!

BOAH, IMMER DIESE KACK WERBUNG VON #sat1 #rage #superbowl

Wow! That's a weird start to the game! #SuperBowl

Wtf jus happened? What kind of shit is this? SAFETY! #Superbowl

What the fuck are they doing now?! Stop fannying about and do something! #superbowl

Turns out 'Safety First' isn't always the best option. #superbowl #giants #patriots

Ahhh the first of several million SMASH ads tonight #superbowl

#flag!! nice #tommyboy keep it up. The betting over here is blowing up. #superbowl #nfl

O so #Smash is on tomorrow. NOW I get it. #Superbowl

Wayyyyy too many breaks in this game. #SuperBowl

#ffs Brady, what are you doing? At least make it look like you were throwing it to someone! :L #Superbowl

And there goes everyone's expectations for their Super Bowl squares pools LOL #SuperBowl

Note to self, keep the cheetah in the cage. Thanks Hyundai, #adbowl #superbowl #hyundai

Watching the #Superbowl in my Knightsbridge house  there's an English commentator  what the !?

#SuperBowl Score Update: 8:52 left in 1st, Patriots QB Flagged for Grounding! Resulting a Safety! New York #Giants 2 - Patriots 0. #GoGiants

Not that we're biased but so far our vote for best #superbowl ad is the RMHC commercial! #strengthinnumbers

Poor decision by Brady there turning the game over to commercials #superbowl

Umwho was that girl in the Pepsi commercial? Am I supposed to know her? #Pepsi #SuperBowl

Tom brady. Ahaha u blew it ! #SuperBowl

Melanie amaro ( x factor winner ) did amazing in her pepsi commercial #SuperBowl sunday

Wow! Intentional grounding! Fa real? #SuperBowl

I'm watching the #SuperBowl with the Polar Bears They're watching LIVE right now! #GameDayPolarBears

Did Pepsi just dress Elton John up as an old queen? #superbowl #ads

First score a safety on a penalty?  Didn't bet on that #Superbowl #vegas

Oh piss off with your illuminati triangle shit #superbowl #nygiants

Brady This Game Is Toooo Important Fr You To Be Fckin Up Niggaaa.! #SuperBowl

And everyone with weird numbers in their #superbowl squares are rejoicing.

That was a really stupid way to give up 2 points.  Best game of career off to a bad start. *smh* #SuperBowl #fb

I don't get it, I'm going to bed. #superbowl

5 minutes into the game, and thanks to that safety, Vegas is already the biggest winner #SuperBowl

The Giants D line is so good they get safeties without tackling anyone #SuperBowl

if they were called the New Canadian Patriots you would love them #superbowl

And that's why you can't give Tom Brady time. #SuperBowl

I'm only watching the #SuperBowl for the commercials and the half time show

The Safety by Tommy Brady will motivate the Patriots Defense! #superbowl

Might look more shiny and colourful. But you don't see that final ball go into the back of the net and everyone go fucking mental!#Superbowl

What n the A safety? Seriously Brady? Wow, the G-Men got u shook already? #Superbowl

The #Pepsi commercial made me laugh because of Flava Flave #SuperBowl

O.k., the Elton John #pepsi commercial was kinda funny. #superbowl  #superbowl

Watching the #Superbowl at the SU, planning to stay as long as I can

who would have thought #TomBrady wouldgive #giants their first points???  #Go Giants!  #indianapolis#superbowl

THESE #superbowl COMMERCIALS MUST BE SERIOUS CAUSE YALL SHOW IS TALKIN ABOUT IT. THEY AIN'T ALL THAT TO ME. TRILL TALK.

Why do I have to fly NOW?? Is it worth missing my flight to watch the #superbowl

Don't usually watch nfl but #superbowl is unreal #cmonthepatriots #bbcsuperbowl

Great #Pepsi commercial, but who the heck was that singer?? #SuperBowl

Elton John ad Flava Flava made a commercial appearance #superbowl

Yay Congrats on the #Pepsi #Superbowl commercial yeeeeeaaaaaa boooooyyyyy! & Flavor Flav!!

Love watchin my boy Brady almost as much as those #SuperBowl commercials #gopats

I know the #superbowl is on, but keep reading my boxing blog!

Dont feel like being bothered.. however I do wanna a plate! Heading to my God sis house in a lil bit #Superbowl

God, this game makes me confuzzled. #superbowl

Those two points could decide the game. Come on ref. #superbowl

#Superbowl might suck im watching it for the commercials anyways with my rum and pepsi good sunnday

Go Tom Brady thanks for the 2 points #giants #nfl #superbowl

chef'n up the #Superbowl Party Grub .. Waitin' on the Wings then the BBQ Ribs go in next. luckily i chef'd this one last night. #munchies

I love my great uncles and guy cousins. I'm always one of the guys with them. Haha. #superbowl

The Irish pub I'm at in Spain is streaming a British network for #SuperBowl super bummer that I can join in on all the #brandbowl fun

THAT FUCKS UP EVERYONES SUPER BOWL POOLS!!!!!#SuperBowl

- great ad, but where's the #PepsiForAll hashtag call out? You fail social. #SuperBowl #Commercials

Wish I bet a safety was going to be the opening score, can only imagine the odds #SuperBowl

lol that girl know she can sing . #superbowl

The Pepsi Commercial with Elton John   Was a good one!!!! #SuperBowl

Anybody know the odds for first score in the #superbowl being a safety?

Well, that's an inauspicious beginning. If the #Giants win by 2 pts, Brady will have to wear a disguise when he visits Boston. #SuperBowl

Gisele is shown and Brady gets a safety. Coincidence? #SuperBowl

who do you thin will win the #superbowl :)? xxxxxxx

From now on, i will be referring to the #SuperBowl as the #AdBowl or the #CommercialBowl. Maybe the former, 'cuz it's shorter.

Elton's shoes were awesomereminds me of the old days. Almost makes up for that damn safetyTB what were thinking? #superbowl

Hyundai trending worldwide due to #superbowl campaign, the power of #advertising

My #Superbowl commercial My car for sale:

Awww  #OOMF finally has a team in the  #Superbowl it took her four teams to get her  congrats

Defenses are looking really violent tonight for both teams.  #Superbowl

The only time the nfl interests me is the #superbowl

I'm here. You're so packed it's ridic! #superbowl

Bouta Get Off Twitter Everybody & They Mama Bouta Be Tweeting About The #SuperBowl.

Read tweets During the footballwatch the commercials when they come on #superbowl

Man, the #Patriots need to holla at Bane for some of that Titan juice. #SuperBowl

The #superbowl = The one day it is socially acceptable for men to cry.

Dammit. Everyone's love tweeting about #superbowl and i'm just here. I wanna see all the cool commercials. :/

'who's that Dan guy?' 'he's the reciever' 'sounds faggy to me.. what a gay' - my mum. DITTO. #superbowl

Tom Brady scores first For the Giants. #idiot #superbowl

Lets go patriots Since is supporting giants #SuperBowl

Mom just came in and asked me if I wanted wings and other junk foods. Well duhhhhh, it's #superbowl day #lovemymom

Just 60/1 for a safety as the first score ? Thought it would've been around 250/1 #superbowl

I don't UNDERSTAND the #SuperBowl and why it's so popular. Even I could play this. I can pretend to do something in five second bursts.

#superbowl the only sport where your allowed to be fat

uh oh it looks like the giants bouta creep up on one #SuperBowl

At what point does intentional grounding become merely a bad throw? Presumably whenever it's done by Kyle Orton. #SuperBowl

Oh Tom Brady, just sit on our face and let us guess your weight #superbowl

First points of the game are on a safety from an intentional grounding penalty?! #superbowl

and I like the Veloster, but that commercial sucked too #auto #cars #SuperBowl #BrandStrategy

The #Superbowl is difficult for those of us who are in the ad industry AND big football fans. You don't want to miss anything! #nobreaks

I'ts time. Let's go Giants. #SuperBowl #bigblue

Why is this so popular? Never realised stopping and starting could be so entertaining. #SuperBowl

Anyone have a clue what's going on in the #superbowl,at least they played some Ozzy Osbourne before it started.

Currently watching #Superbowl hmm who gonna take it!

The #SuperBowl is underway! What are you doing for the big game?

Can't wait for to be done with work so she can watch the #Superbowl with me, #JasonRSmith37

53 million people just learned what a safety is. #superbowl

Somewhere some dude just won shitload of $ because first score was a safety. #SuperBowl

I take washroom breaks during the game so I don't miss the commercials. #SuperBowl

Flavor Flav in that Pepsi commercial lmfao #superbowl

So far Patriots defence has been a joke! #SuperBowl #BBCSuperBowl

And just like that 2 points on de board! #SUPERBOWL #LETSGOGIANTS

#SuperBowl Wonder how many placed a bet that the 1st score would be a safety?

The #Giants are 2-0 in games this yr in which they've had scored a safety. (Jets-Cowboys) #superbowl

Trying to figure out which demon the giants sold their soul too. #GIANTS #superbowl

How much money-back be lost in Vegas because of that safety?  #SuperBowl

Stuck at somewhere that isn't showing the super bowl and want to watch it LIVE, go to  First time in #Superbowl history

Are your kids showing their #SuperBowl spirit? We're collecting pics of the CUTEST little fans!

Sippin a Stella waiting for the commercials. That's my #SuperBowl

Girls don't wanna know about the game in fact. They just wanna see the players!!! hahaha #superbowl american football

The Audi ad with vampires the funniest so far with Elton n Pepsi 2nd #Superbowl

RT Oh Elton, you queen. Denying the public its Pepsi. #superbowl

My Super Bowl experience is sadly lacking in the John Madden department! Foooooooooooootbaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllll!!!!! #superbowl

Got to love a good stiff arm #NYG #superbowl

Who predicted that? 1st pts of the game is a safety!!! #SuperBowl Keep the momentum goin Giants!!!

I hope all these Rugby buff can see that passing the ball forward makes a lot of sense. #superbowl

The #SuperBowl is apparently jealous of #worldseries scoring. I'm hoping for a nice 3-2 game

Now this is what I call a good start.  SAFETY! #GoBigBlue #superbowl

I don't know who I wanna win the #superbowl. Go bears! Lol jk

Be on da #lookout during #Superbowl 4 one of my clients 's #GIJoe trailer!! One of the coolest people I've cooked 4 #NOLAchef

Chung also needs to learn how to tackle #horrible #Patriots #Giants #SuperBowl

Stop, Start, Stop, Start, Half time, Stop, Start, just fecking get on with it!#superbowl #slow #boring

Sure is nice to see someone with the last name of Manning put up some numbers in Indy! #Colts #superbowl #Giants

I remember this from last year:  #superbowl #superbowl2012

Number 44 is a dude he smooshed the other guy in the face.. #SuperBowl

I'm expanding my sport horizons #superbowl here I come!

Would like to play American Football competitivley,  love the sport!  #superbowl

Do not understand the #SuperBowl rules one bit

giants have some good forward play, said this would be tight #superbowl

I wonder how many people just got screwed out of money by that safety? #SuperBowl #OopsTomBrady

Reading  and live tweet the game is more entertaining than the commercials. #SuperBowl #rodrigobowl

I'll never get used to NFL coaches who look like the homeless.. #SuperBowl

Ah yes the #Superbowl, another excuse to drink!

I can't be bothered with all this #SuperBowl talk. I'm gonna stick to #fm2012

All #audi (an s series no less!) can come up with is bright headlights?! Ouch. #HowMuchDidThatAdJustCost?#SuperBowl

And the Giants start up by doing the safety dance #SuperBowl

Who paid for the Audi commercial?? That's all inflation buys? #superbowl

RT Did the ref mean to throw the flag in the air? What the fu&k is going on??? #SuperBowl  #WTreF

queens dressing up like kings #superbowl #pepsi

The only reason Im watching the #SuperBowl is to see the hot guys Sorry dad

My Bradshaw jersey is doin the trick.  COTUS makes things happen.  #superbowl

for a more informed but still English view of the #SuperBowl, is worth a follow. (someone explained a safety to me though tar)

my #TL is filled with #SuperBowl stuff and the funny ass commericals

Think I Can Play In The #Superbowl . I've Been Practising With The Snowballs Earlier.

I feel we are about to pour out our first #Free shots of the night!! #Superbowl #Harlem Come on  !!

feeling sorry 4 the studio guests on bbcs #superbowl coverage. they have 2 talk thru every US ad break for next 4 hrs.

#SuperBowl Giants. That's all Anyone can say. No it's not, The Giants!

Nothing like a #superbowl at the Rodriguez house on sackett. BRKLN

Dnt really care 4 sports but I am frm NYC so good luck 2 the #Giants  #SuperBowl

Even though I didn't like the #Pepsi commerical at ALL! I do like that they are hopefully bringing back music artists to the mix. #SuperBowl

A safety to start the game? If only I bet on that before kickoff. #SuperBowl

Sam Gagner got an assist on that safety. #superbowl #jokesonlycanadiansgetOMGFacts..Perfect!

#Giants fans beware. Team USA scored in one play at #internationalbowl this week and lost 35-29. #superbowl.  #ifaf

#Superbowl 75 for NE, who ate all the pies? #bbcsuperbowl

I want Jeremy Shockey to show up and punch Eli in the face. #superbowl

Excited to be home - sushi, barbecue shrimp, and Super Bowl with my boo #Giants #superbowl

Giants are playing pretty damn well. GO GIANTS! #Superbowl

Somebody tweet me the #superbowl scores when it's over so I can look cultured in college tomorrow, I need sleep, goodnight.

You know, considering you all hate American Football so much, you seem to be tweeting an awful lot about the #superbowl. #helmets

This is perhaps the year when women and gays get to watch and appreciate the #Superbowl, all because of #Madonna.Footb

Really enjoyed that Budweiser used Kanye in the #makeitplatinum commercial. #SuperBowl

I'd suggest a sports-cliche drinking game, but I don't have enough vodka. #superbowl

How is it possible to have an epic Manning head and for it to still look so tiny inside a helmet? #superbowl

If I were Eli Manning I would throw the ball to that enormous white man named Bear, too. #SuperBowl

I'm telling you, this would be a much more exciting #SuperBowl to watch if the #DetroitLions were playing.

#SuperBowl guess im not watchn it wit ya

Tough US man on man contest.  I expect Santorum.  #SuperBowl

Who Isnt watching the #superbowl is the question ? lol

Don't 100% understand American Football but I am getting into the #superbowl but must go to sleep. Have to say the men are Hot!!

The Ribs are #winning at Amandas #SUPERBOWL Party! are the taste testers!

Go Patriots! Who are you rooting for? #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl pepsi commercial with Elton Jhonn . Amazing

Tonight, my apathy towards sports combats my unhealthy love of food in a most glorious way. #Superbowl

exactly!!!! I'm not a Manning fan but I really hate Brady.. Hope Giants Win like back in 08 #SuperBowl XLII

That #SuperBowl #Pepsi commercial w/#Elton John, FlavorFlav & Melanie Amaru was awesome. I love how Elton is the Queen. Did you c the shoes?

Patriots might want to learn how to wrap up properly on a tackle  #SuperBowl

Not got a clue what is happening. Too many lines on the pitch for a start. #superbowl

I'm Not A Fan Of Either Team , But I Think Ima Go With The #Giants For The Win Tonight #Superbowl

Brands should not rely on YouTube to start the #SuperBowl hype. #Anticipation

2-0 Yankees over Red Sox #SB46 #ohwait this is #NFL, the #SuperBowl

Sitting like a clueless cunt watching the #Superbowl

I'm not watching the #SuperBowl but all you guys tweeting about it, tweet away, enjoy and may your team win whoever they are :)

#Superbowl (i'm a Cardinals fan) but I had to choose, I choose the Patriots (they have a U of A alumni on their team, I rep only for AZ)

Not impressed by the commercials thus far. The only reason to watch this is for Madonna. #MadonnaSuperBowl #SuperBowl

Haha I agree!  There is gunna be a FIGHT at the #SuperBowl ! There is too much tension ! #Patriots k

very pleased with pre-game singers. No performance was too showy, too extravagant, everyone knew their words! Good work! #superbowl

So was The Count from Sesame Street on standby to make the call? #SuperBowl

Who should I be wanting to win this #superbowl thing? Will be easier to enjoy if I want someone to actually win!

That's two big mistakes by the #Patriots early on #Superbowl

My sister said something about some bradshaw and i was like, is sarah jessica parker playing or? #SuperBowl

The Superbowl is like the Melbourne Cup, once a year we Aussies all become experts on the sport! #SuperBowl

12 men on field? Nice job, Pats. #superbowl

Is it me, or is this a Pee Wee league Patriots team? #SuperBowl

I really hope Tom Brady stayed in a Buffalo hotel last night  #superbowl

Am I the only one who could care less about either of these teams? All I care about is eating, the commercials & the Puppy Bowl. #Superbowl

THIS IS THE #SUPERBOWL HOW U HAVE 12 MEN ON THE FIELD

Well now that I ate all the foodlet's wait to see how the half time show is #SuperBowl

Lots of mistakes being made by the #Patriots in this #superbowl. Can't win that way

Go Giants! Manning, Pascoe and the wide receiver I'm looking out for. #SuperBowl

Browsing #Superbowl on Instagram, there are some creative ways to share bean dip.

Patriots look very nervous so far in this game   #Superbowl

Vampires have hit the ad scene. We've come full circle. Let's make mermaids happen next? #superbowl

When MAC'S about to start cussing you know things have gotten out of hand! #SuperBowl

A lot of Hot Football players, but Tom Brady and Tim Tebow will always be the number 1 for me. #Superbowl

So far the Hyundai commercials are my favorite. #superbowl

If the Giants keep this up, there will be slightly more rioting in my neighborhood this evening. #Superbowl

Accidentally slept through coin toss. Why no replay? Oh well, next year.#gohandbuckets #superbowl

Is the whole of the UK supporting the #Giants? Feel like the world's only #Patriots  fan. #SuperBowl

OH: I'm just gonna root for whoever has the ball. #superbowl

Should have been picked off as well.  #Superbowl

Ok so I understand a touchdown but nothing else #HELP #superbowl

They have a mac n cheese pizza at this #superbowl party

Unlike football in the rest of the world, handegg coaches wear hoodies and have a high BMI. #SuperBowl #firstgamethisseason

What a pass by Eli. Thought they were gonna run it! #touchdown #SuperBowl

Ball control ruling the #SuperBowl so far.

Manning is having a storming 1st quarter #SuperBowl #doIsoundknowledgable

Touchdown Giants! #superbowl Extra point good9-0

For every beer I would have drank I'm be #GreenBowlPackin instead during this #SuperBowl

This look like a regular Sunday night football game. #Superbowl

Yes! 9-0 up! Stop the Patriots on the next drive and you have the chance to create even more breathing space! #Superbowl

So many rules,plays -very confusing #SuperBowl

That was a very boring bud light commercial. #superbowl

Bud Light commercials are super lame.  #superbowl

That pre-game Victor Cruz for MVP pick is looking pretty good right now. #SuperBowl

Eli working like Joe Montana!! #SuperBowl

Why am I watching the #superbowl right now. BORING! change the channel!

Uncharacteristic start for New England with just one play to the Giants' 20. #SuperBowl #sb46

I have no dog in the fight so let's go commercials! #Superbowl

M&Ms never make uncute ads.  #bcbowl #superbowl

- YEAH GIANTS!!! Tweeting with one hand. Other is smothered in wings sauce. #superbowl

#SUPERBOWL #PATS #GIANTS  MF NAKED M&MS HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA

Mannings got a throw on him, good luck patriots #NYG #superbowl

I really love Cruz. Best M&Ms commercial ever!! #SuperBowl

M&Ms commercial wins so far #superbowl

SCORE UPDATE: Manning throws a 2 Yard TD pass to Victor Cruz :D and then the field goal is good :D  Giants 9, Patriots 0 #SuperBowl

Typical, I turn the #superbowl off for 10 seconds and I miss the first #touchdown #sodslaw

hate that Canada is so LAME they dont show the #superbowl commercials!! KMTTTT

Well the #superbowl didn't ruin everything.. At least #Shameless is still new

Vanessa Williams is finally able to laugh at her nudity scandal via an M&Ms commercial 29 years later. #SuperBowl

I think I need to go to bed now.  They just played bad Kinks.  And frankly Im annoying myself now.  Let alone anyone else #superbowl

Why do I have a feeling that number 80 from the Giants will now be on the list for DWTS? #superbowl #NewYorkGiants

just made the first touchdown of the #superbowl. Let's go #giants.

It's not that I don't care about the #superbowl, it's just that I am still hurting over the Packers not being in it.

Watching #LoveStruckMovies and the #Superbowl :) What a great combo for the night 3

I hate the Pats so I'm going for the Giants #SuperBowl

where to watch #superbowl live on the net? a kingdom for a link! :)

Best commercial so far was the naked m&m commercial. So funny! #SuperBowl

Look out for my parents at the #SuperBowl - they are on the 40 yd line, halfway up, sitting next to #LovieSmith, #nojoke. #lucky

This guy presenting on the bbc clearly has no idea what is going on #superbowl

The M & M commercial is stupid! Lol #superbowl

Why on earth do 1D fans make EVERYTHING about them!! GET A LIFE!! #superbowl

Alright, alright. 9-0, darn it. We'll just see if the Patriots' offense can push through the Giants' defense. I think they can. #SuperBowl

Sippin on drinks & eating wings during. #superbowl

YAAAY first touchdown in the #SuperBowl & it was by a PUERTO RICAN  Victor Cruz :)x Puerto Rico rules

Only thing better than #Brady on his ass is #Giants with the ball for 19 minutes. #GoGiants #SuperBowl

I'm suppose to be watching the #superbowl with #2omf right now.

That m&m commercial was too funny !! Lmfao !! #superbowl

Well my pick of the Patriots is going well..NOT! Sill long way to go - lets hope they wake up with their next attempt at offence.#Superbowl

New england patriots would be winning if Peter griffen still played for them #Superbowl  #FamilyGuy

So #SuperBowl isn't only a bunch of overweight, overpadded men doing knees up, it mostly consists of 'action' replays?

Really you call this HD? #superbowl bowl party COULD have been cool with

Equally bad start by patriots way too many errors #Superbowl

Tonight is my lil brothers favourite day of the year. Wish I was there to annoy him xo #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Memorable way to introduce M&M Brown

I guess I'll root for the Giants since I'm from New York #superbowl

This #Superbowl sucks so far! C'mon Pats!

#SuperBowl so far I love the m&m commercial!! Not your average chocolate ;)

Danny Woodhead, Chadron State grad, #Nebraska #NCAA all time leading rusher #Superbowl

Best Buy commercial effectiveinformative not overly entertaining 6 rating at our #superbowl 46 party

#superbowl why do they keep on stopping every 30seconds. Get on with the game

M&M takes first funny commercial award #SuperBowl

4th annual #SuperBowl snack stadium of junk food awesomeness (architect =

usually saying COYB but today its COYG #COYG #LetsGoGiants #Superbowl

M&M and Pepsi  are the best commercials so far! #SuperBowl

Why can't Australia get America's ads when the #SuperBowl is on!

Cant wait for Madonna's performance at half time. Hopefully it's Nikki Minaj who's guess performing. #excited #superbowl

#Gmen starting the game off right!!! Let's keep it up u guys!!!! #superbowl #NYG

Hashtags on every #Superbowl commercial. Brand integration!

Whaddup Patriots? TOM BRADY SO CONFIDENT NOW? #SuperBowl

Doing my best to visualize the US #SuperBowl commercials using only my imagination and the tweets of my American frien

Ohhh Aerosmith - Walk This Way. Loving the #Superbowl so far! #GoPatriots

At $3.5 million for a 30 sec commercial those corporate-people surely are wasting their cash on a whole lotta crap so far. #Superbowl

#SuperBowl Let me tall yall NYC ppl, Tom Brady still will bust that ass. Don't let him get in the zone.

I never knew Americans could invent something so confusing have you guys tried Cricket? #superbowl

Not Hanna lie, I liked the m&m commercial #superbowl

Delay reaction! Touchdown Giants! Go Cruzzzz!!! #superbowl

I love the Coke polar bear commercials too #SuperBowl

Best commercial so far was the m&ms brown great work #superBowl

#4EvrSelina: I'm uncomfortable w/ how sexual the m&ms are. Friend across the table: Soon they'll be S&Ms #SuperBowl

Do not lose faith.  Do not lost faith.  #SuperBowl

Well this sucks, commercials in Canada are all old.. Or Canadian.. #SuperBowl

Tom Brady & the Pats will take over from their own 29 yard-line #SuperBowl

If 10% of the money wasted on the #Superbowl were spent on humanitarian causes #TheWorldWouldBeABetterPlace

Um, naked M&Ms are chocolate chips. Don't be fooled. #superbowl

I like the #Pats but I gotta pull for my boys #Jacobs and #Nicks!! #nyg #SuperBowl

I love all the American tv ads #superbowl

Wonder how much #chrysler must of paid to advertise in the #superbowl bet that cost a pretty penny

Rarely a good sign when your kick returner is a cracker.#SuperBowl

they should just have a compact highlights package #SuperBowl

The m&m's commercial was so cute! #SuperBowl

Awww at that polar bear coca cola commercial :) #superbowl

Sorry world for the crazy tweets but it's just one of those days :) #SuperBowl

They ended up with 12 men because there are 374852 on each team! BOUND to get confusing! #superbowl

#SuperBowl ok so these commercials startin off lame af

The #SuperBowl just isn't the same when you hate both teams playing. #whatisthisworldcomingto

ZOMBIELAND CHEVY COMMERCIAL?!?!?!?!?! OMGGGG LOVE. #SUPERBOWL #Commercials

Good to see the the polar bears back. #SuperBowl

Okay, didn't get that last commercial. #SuperBowl

OH SNAP!  Chevy ad pwns Ford.  hahaha Their company sucks, but love the ad!  #Superbowl

Hahaha. I actually love this Chevy commercial. #superbowl

Tried to watch a bit of the #Superbowl Why would anyone want to watch three hours of adverts? Does the winner of the best ad win something?

So the Chevy ad takes place in downtown Los Angeles? #SuperBowl

The only thing that excites me about the #SuperBowl is Her Madgesty, Madonna.

Moral to Chevy commercial: If you drive a Ford, you deserve to die. #superbowl

Rt if you ain't gotta clue bout American football #superbowl a game where u hardly ever put your foot through the ball. Clues in the title!

I prefer the commercials with animated characters over actual people. #superbowl

Haha!  Twinkles survived the apocalypse.  (wait, we're the cars important?)  #Superbowl

Victor CruzSalsa time!!! Go NY GIANTS!!! #Superbowl

I'm just ready for #TheVoice to come on after #SuperBowl

Ha, that #Chevy commercial was cute. Love the Twinkies. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlCommercials

I'm so lazyI'm just re-tweeting everything  says!  #Superbowl

that was a great TDP, let hope for many more #Giants #Superbowl

When does Jim McMahon start playing?  Based on the music going into the breaks, I'm assuming we're seeing the '85 #SuperBowl all over again.

I hated everything about that Chevy commercial. #superbowl

If 4 men are the only ones left at the end of the world.well looks like humanity will die anyway haha. #SuperBowl

Whilst this is all very entertainingthe #superbowl coverage definately needs these two

HAHAHAHA NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII(never gonna buy a Chevy)IIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCE!!!!!!!! #SuperBowl

confusing how Patriots in Scottish colours but Scottish guy in team with English colours! #SuperBowl

Madonna can go Fuck her self I'm turning off during HT #Superbowl

RUMOR HAS IT there are HALF A BILLION around the world watching/streaming the #superbowl live rn!!! #MadonnaSuperBowl

Looking at all the amusing tweets is way more entertaining than actually watching the #superbowl

First quarter still and it's been on nearly an hour #superbowl vs #bedtime

Best #SuperBowl commercial so far. #M&M's dancing to #LMFAO's-Sexy and I Know It.

Polar bearsI can totally relate. #Bear #LikeThat #SuperBowl

Ew he looks JUST like his brother #SUPERBOWL

So, in retrospect, perhaps Belichick shoulda been more of a meanie this week. #superbowl

#superbowl is the only time theres no time to pee, cant miss the game or commercials

Dogs & chips have been served. #superbowl

Why are the #superbowl ads in Canada so terrible? #thisisbullshit

I need coke cola to do better with that janky ass commercial #superbowl

Next years #SuperBowl  will have a transformers commercial

my neighbor banging on the wall tryna get me 2 calm down yelling at the TV. he must not know its #superbowl time! he'll be ok for one night

So far the Patriots are as disappointing as the commercials #SuperBowl #LateShowWriters

I heard NBC is streaming #Superbowl live online

I can honestly say this is the worst sport I've ever watched. 3 seconds of action then back to the studio? #boreoff #Superbowl

#superbowl seems awfully boring after watching #Wales and #Ireland battle it out for 80 minutes in A real sport today.

Advertisers learning. Most #SuperBowl commercials sport a hashtag.

#SuperBowl are helmets really needed? I watched the rugby today not a helmet in sight! #RealMen

Really liked the Chevy end of the world ad #brandbowl #superbowl

According to Chevy the end of the world will be a total sausagefest With twinkies. #Superbowl #ads #SB46

While you watch the #SuperBowl on cable, I'm tuned in on On my phone. And iPad. Commercials too. Welcome to the future!

Really didn't think the giants would take the lead. Not to mention totally boss the game so far. #superbowl

Can someone explain to me why the #superbowl has more exposure than #icehockey here in UK even though the fan base is

Euyyghyhan old guy's hitting on me. Get me outta this #SuperBowl party!

#Superbowl so the underdogs are leading 9-0 so far!

WTF is up with #SuperBowl, everytime time a guy makes a tackle he starts doing a bit of zumba #confused

Drinking #budlightplatinum while watching #superbowl commercials for #budlightplatinum. It is delish and tastes exactly like bud light

Please use #legitsauce in your #SuperBowl tweets.  Let's get it trending for those starving kids in Africa.

RT loving these #superbowl commercialsbetween the Audi vampires & naked M&M it's got us all cracking up #bestpartaboutthegame

I also liked seeing big names in tech in the Best Buy ad #SuperBowl

The english rugby team would destroy the player #SuperBowl

that's what I thought. Sister has ARMS, and I ain't mad at her! #Superbowl

going to be tired in work tomorrow bud are we trying to get #superbowl trending lol

Ok. Chevy truck 2012 Mayan calendar commercial was pretty funny. Even though I do drive a Ford. #SuperBowl

[P] Takei on Celebrity Apprentice? Warp factor fired. #SuperBowl

I'd hate to play in a game wheres there's an ad break like every 5  minutes! #justsaying #SuperBowl

I love that #superbowl gave me a chance to sing Barry Manilow and embarrass myself.

Watching the #Superbowl even though I don't really understand the rules or have a team to truly support. It's kind of like politics.

I need this money I hope they win! #superbowl

I can see the need for the helmets nowbut that is all I understand so far#ConfusingSport #NFL #Superbowl

#Superbowl a guy threw a ball another guy caught it and a score happened

First time watching an American Football game. Now I know what it must feel like to be a woman watching football (real football) #SuperBowl

Loved Melanie Amaro in the Pepsi commercial wasn't  expecting Flav at the end #SuperBowl

Dear all Scramble with Friends opponents, Clearly I'm not going to play you during the #SuperBowl. Sorry. -Ross

DYK: the pronghorn can run up to 100km/hr. Don't think even the best runningback can run that fast! Just sayin' #nccmashup #Superbowl

#Superbowl i really dont get this shit- Isnt it rugby for wimps?

Why am I even watching the #SuperBowl both teams suck?! The commercials is all I'm watching.

These guys celebrate after doing something which they're supposed to be doing 'I made a tackleI'm going to dougie' #excited #superbowl

I heard you like football, so I put a football in your football so you can football while you football #superbowl

#Cheatriots trying to get on the board after a dismal 1st quarter. #SuperBowl.

Soooooooooo. . . .are all the #Superbowl commercials gonna be about Tires & Pepsi ? Just asking.

are you one of them or a real fan? I normally only watch #Bills games and #Superbowl of course!

As far as I can tell, the physics of football does not match the physics of the universe. #superbowl

What's the point of wearing your favorite rocketship underwear if no one asks to see them? #moreimportant then the #superbowl

So far kinda confused by some of the advertising during the #SuperBowl. However, M&Ms definitely delivered the goods!

Any american who have seen #ManUtd vs. #cfc  today knows he can't call #Superbowl  ( football ) any more #fact .

Yeah even the #superbowl has its flaws

Two hours until Downton Abbey. #SuperBowl

#superbowl end of the first quarter. #bridgestone is looking old.

Can never make myself watch football so I'll just watch the commercials later and do something else while #superbowl is on. ~J

Disappointed in the commercial #bestbuy put out for the #superbowl.  Probably spent way too much for something so under

Hey if you're going to be sexist, can you at least be original about it? Yawn.com. Sheesh. #superbowl

On my way to eat wit my mom, sis, and babe (: #SuperBowl

What in the blazes was that commercial Go Daddy?? #SuperBowl

The only time people enjoy commercials #SuperBowl

Bridgestone good. Love the pass. Don't like godaddy ads. Lexus eh. #superbowl

So I've learned that Bridgestone makes footballs, GoDaddy is scum and Lexus now apparently makes velociraptors. #SuperBowl

Love how most of the #SuperBowl commercials have a special #hashtag to go with.

Realized that pausing and rewind means I'm a bit behind in the game. Gotta catch up. #SuperBowl

#superbowl and #commercials make my night!! Oh and donnas food!!! #bestever #handsdown

Who is better, Tom Brady or Eli Manning? Because I thought Manning was the ting but bare people are loving Brady Atm #superbowl!

Giants killed it in the 1qtLet's see if the Pats manage to recover on the 2 #superbowl

Change can not be detained! That's powerful! #SuperBowl

Fitting the godaddy girls were painting seeing how thir fake tan looks like it was done by glidden #GoPats #NFL #SuperBowl

Giants have a strong beginning let's hope it stays that way #superbowl

My tv is haunted. And when is going to be in a commercial?#SuperBowl

I walk away to get a #superbowl of ice cream and the score has changed. What happend?

I'd like to think Mike Carlson knows a lot about NFL, but I know that Warren Barton is the main EPL pundit in America. #SuperbOwl

I'm not sure that changing to godaddy.co will make people forget that they once backed #SOPA #Superbowl #godaddy #nicetry

SOURCES: Tim Tebow refuses to use or go to GoDaddy for fear of what he might see #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl is the only time everyone and their grand mom tweets about commercials lls

Wait, is godaddy.com a porn site? Im not sure, but either way I'm masturbating to it #SuperBowl

I'm hearing bout them Giants tho , LoL #superbowl

Every superbowl ever will have movie trailers where things explode from the makers of something else where stuff exploded. #Superbowl

Oh, the #superbowl kicked off? Good! Time to hit the peacefully empty gym.  Gym Bucktown w/ 2 others)

Cooper Manning's savings wiped out by 10 grand ticket price.  #superbowl

With the half naked chics in the #commercial  #GoDaddy ought to use GoDaddy.Ho   #superbowlcommercial  #SuperBowl

I really would just like to see Madonna perform at halftime before I go to bed #superbowl or has it passed already.forget it goodnite

Some of the players are too chubby. That's disgusting. #Superbowl

As the quarter ends with the Patriots on the doorstep, cue whining from the losers with 9 & 7 as their squares. #SuperBowl

#superbowl . What's next, monopoly the movie.  He rolled a four he's going to jail

Honestly don't know what the fucks going on! #superbowl

#superbowl #nbc streaming fail - come on guys it's 2012, it's not like streaming is 'hard'

Just learned why brady was grounded, lol #pressureplay #superbowl

Commercials are reeeally disappointing so far. I might as well just go to the bathroom like normal  #superbowl

#superbowl you can only speculate who you think will win; but nobody can predict. Superbowl is a game of destiny!

Giants doing work Patsy's are making a lot of mental mistakes! #superbowl #Giants

there must be some hosers playing nhl12 drop-in games. anything but the #SuperBowl plz

#Superbowl #NewYorkGiants all the way. Been to their stadium twice, not for this shit, but for #ManUnited

Quite a few people seem to have prepared for #SuperBowl but I'm just lying in bed using a live tv app to watch it on my iPhone

I need a milkshake to accompany me during #SuperBowl XLVI. My dear blender, where are you???

To watch the #SuperBowl or go to sleep? Infact watching it will probably help in falling asleep! #BoringSport

We get it go daddy. Your middle aged women are attractive and we need to go to your website to see a girl in a bikini. #SuperBowl #stfu

God the commercials suck this year.  Ever since the Janet incident everything is so censored and funny.  #SuperBowl #SuperBowlAds

I just got out my bed and turned on my laptop to see what this #superbowl is about. Curiousity could kill me one day

$3 million for a 30 second commercial spot during the #SuperBowl

So far pretty disappointed in #SuperBowl #commercials. M&Ms and chevy got a chuckle

Of all the apocalyptic objects you see in this Chevy #sb46 commercial, only the Twinkie is real. #admeter #superbowl

It's about timeNo body likes a blowout.#BigGameFashion #SuperBowl

It costs $100,000 per second for a commercial during the #SuperBowl

Great D, Pierre Paul is a beast #SuperBowl #Giants

Watching the #Superbowl with guys who don' t know football sux donkey balls!

Battleship looks like the brightest, shiniest, explodiest piece of shit pinched from the unholy ass of Hollywood. #superbowl #ads

Supporting the opposite of who everyone else is backing just to be a dick. #superbowl

Ah well, punt team got the 3 points. Could see it going either way at the moment. #Superbowl

Pats on the board Now defence step up #superbowl

Somehow missed the whole first quarter :-/ did I miss any good commercials?? #SuperBowl

#music #radio #uk #Superbowl The England Swings Show  #nowplaying :  Lana Del Rey - Born To Die

The Patriots finally scores, bad news it was just a Field Goal #Superbowl

Rob Lowe doing a promo on the jumbotron for Parks and Recs. Really, Lowe in Indy? What does Peyton Manning think of that? #SuperBowl

Really You couldn't find a single woman and/or person of color tech developer? #SuperBowl #NotBuyingIt

29 yard field goal for Patriots. NY Giants lead 9-3 13:48/2Q. #SuperBowl

Yeah, #Budweiser? Prohibition has denied Americans marijuana for going on 75 years! #GrabAHealthierBud #SuperBowl

Every dang year.  Seriously Go Daddy? Your commericals are tired & played out. #Superbowl #sbads

What goodies r peps mking for the #superbowl???

Patriots score 3 points, here come the adverts!!! #superbowl

I personally think that the giants are going to roll this game, but we'll see what happens. #Superbowl #Giants

#superbowl 1st quarter goes to Giants. They owned the pats big time. Score 9 to 0. Big play: Brady got busted grounding, cost him a safety.

Haha awesome M&M commercial! I'm sexy and I know it! #superbowl

Night! Gonna watch the #SUPERBOWL another time. To tired x

You know, w/o all these expensive commercials, it would never occur to people to drink beer. #SuperBowl

Finally, some NE points on the board #superbowl

#superbowl is really something, brady versus manning Gimme a slice of this action, skysports one HD yes please!

Nearly 2mins into 2nd Quarter and #NewEnglandPatriots make their 1st score. Its #NewYorkGiants 9-3 #Patriots #SuperBowl

Americans created a sport only they can understand #SuperBowl

Remember when Budweiser commercials used to be funny? #SuperBowl

Me and the big bro chillaxin'&relaxin. Just kickin it back at this #SuperBowl party

The Budweiser commercial is awesome. Having seen the Clydesdale horses in person is really spectacular and I just adore them. #Superbowl

#budlightplatnium I'm intrigued! We just can't figure it out! #superbowl

The second college level mistake in the game. The machine is broken. #superbowl | Yup. Parody football.

Friend commented the Budweiser commercials makes us all look like alcoholics #SuperBowl

Supposed to make 135 soon, but damn this #SuperBowl food is good!

since when do the #SuperBowl and homework go hand in hand? for some reason events like this are always on the wrong days.

so has the #superbowl started yet or what, there so many breaks i don't know whats going on

No matter who wins. This is some great football. #SUPERBOWL #bbcsuperbowl

Hate that my sisters watching TV when I want to watch the #Superbowl

If there was this many breaks in a real football match I'd probably rip my face off #NoNeed #superbowl

Why did that dog get the Chik-Fil-A cows to write his threatening note? #doritos #superbowl

These cute boys in the blue jerseys need to kick up their game.  #superbowl

Pls when is Shooting Stars playing in the #superbowl?

Sucks to suck. 12 guys on the field? How'd you get to the #SuperBowl?

Watching the #SuperBowl because I'm an absolute hero!

Best #clydesdale #bud commercial ever. #superbowl. Super funny #Doritos ad. Loved it.

I'vr never been at party where bud was the main beer and it was a good time #superbowl

Finally a #Budweiser commercial. Now it feels like #SuperBowl Sunday.

Doritos had the best commercial so far #SuperBowl

Budweiser: extremists are bad, m'kay? Doritos: bugs did it better. Chevy: meh. #Superbowl

Whats your favorite #Superbowl commercial so far? #buckscounty

Giselle needs to run around field naked to distract giants #superbowl

#superbowl Doritos wins dog folk. Chevy holding strong.

#superbowl is kinda slow right now. Lets go giants!

Well in other news.. The #Giants are winning so far (: #SuperBowl

Thats better #nzvszim but #SuperBowl will still get the majority of the tv surf time #nemmind

Always love the Doritos commercials every #SuperBowl

How funny was that Doritos commercial? #superbowl HAHAHA

#Superbowl commercials suck so far!  I hope they stepped it up.

See the Clydesdale enjoy a bud! #ChevyGame Time Chevy commercial funny. #Superbowl

Who gives their graduation college student a refrigerator out at the curb??? #superbowl

#doritos best commercial so far at #superbowl the rest are marginal.

Budweiser going nostalgic, but anyone who watches Boardwalk Empire knows prohibition never existed in the first place! #SuperBowl #Ads

here is the only #superbowl tweet i will post. enjoy.

I swear the only time I like commercials is during the #superbowl

Tha Doritos commercial was the funniest commercial so far #Superbowl

Budweiser Ad best of the night so far, Why Doritos always have Dogs?, and I would scream for a Chevy #SBAds #SuperBowl

Those consecutive Doritos and Chevy commercials were both funny. #SuperBowl

This still doesn't make much sense to me #superbowl

Can't have #Superbowl without hot wings :)

This murdering dog commercial is probably the best one yet. Not a good sign #SuperBowl

Hahahahahahaha  I can't believe you got me this car! #Superbowl

I suppose even a Bud would taste good at the end of Prohibition. B+ #superbowl

Ugh. How can I get #pats to 14 or 24 now by half? Thanks, #tombrady for that crap pass. #superbowl

yow! What does that tweet have to do with the #SuperBowl ???

Just finish my wonderful delicious Sunday Dinner thank u mama j.now time 2 tune#superBowl sexii man in tights  always get me hot n bother!

Tempted to watch #SuperBowl but I do not plan to stay up till 4.

The chevy camaro commercial was too sweet!! Got excited as Ido what. I probably would too #Superbowl

Commercial - GE: Cool tech commercial. No comedy though. Not rating. #SuperBowl

Have they started filling in the wrinkles on Madonna for her performance tonight? #superbowl

Breakfast is served. Palm corned beef, sinangag, hotdog, cheesedog, and egg. Let's go Pats!!! #superbowl

Another reason to hate the Giants: one of my squares had them up 2-0. Damn. #superbowl

I also enjoyed the Doritos ad, as did my dog. #superbowl

LOL loved the Camero commercial with the graduates. Too funny! #Chevy #SuperBowl

When #SuperBowl come I look forward to them  doritos commercials them shit be funny

Loving my #superbowl of corn flakes, that's what everyone's talking about right  breakfast ?

Wish we were seeing the yank adverts! They are really cool for the #superbowl

niggas don't knw how to act the only rappers allowed are diddy,flo-rida,or jigga there more white folk #superbowl friendly

If you like the Eagles or Cowboys and are rooting for the Giants to win the #SuperBowl Go sit in timeout.

Oh are we live tweeting Super Bowl commercials? Cuz M&Ms totally went French! #SuperBowl

American football = Really weak version of rugby #superbowl #allaboutadvertising

Really wanna c the commercials specially wen every1s saying how good they r stupid uk don't play em #superbowl

I love the #Superbowl.  Everyone's busy watching the game and not bothering me!  I CAN WRITE! #amwriting #amrevising

Use the bathroom while the game is on..but hurry back to make sure u don't miss any of the commercials #superbowl

Wish Cecil Martin would stop shouting. You have a microphone you pleb #superbowl

#superbowl #chevy. Best commercial. He stole my camero!

So it's 9-3 in the #superbowl. And I thought Blackburn had a bad defence! #ImaynotunderstandAmericanFootball

congrats on the movie. Just saw clip during #SuperBowl. It looks likes it's gonna be a blockbuster.

Let us not forget Archimedes, Merlin's pet owl in The Sword in the Stone  #SuperbOwl

I'm more excited about the commercials than the actual game..is that bad? Lol #SuperBowl

Now that I've had time to process it..that high note towards the end had me dead for the past 45 mins. Thanks #superbowl

Hope everyone is enjoying the #Superbowl! Who are u for? The Giants are looking good! #NC

Finally a doritos commercial  #superbowl has funny!

I approve of the co-branding in that GE spot. #AdBowl #Superbowl #BrandBowl

#pepsi commercial with Elton John and Flavor Flav was the best! #superbowl

I actually know what is going on and understand the rules. Some boy? #SuperBowl

the winner of the #superbowl commercials is clearly tim riggins and his new movies #fnl

#SuperBowl Budweiser prohibition was long time ago, Is this anti-Romey ad or something. Don't get point. Makes you look

Seriously can't make a decision what to watch #puppyBowl or #superBowl. Both just as good

Two minutes of game. Three minutes of commercials.  Now I remember why I don't care about the #superbowl

Poor sanitation contaminates #water. 1.5 M kids die annually from diarrheal diseases via - Toilet bowl - #Superbowl

Our vote: #Chevy and #Doritos winning #Superbowl commercials so far.

Doritos always has the best #SuperBowl commercials. So far, that's still the case.

What shitty parents gets their kid a mini-Fridge as a graduation present? #Superbowl

How are One Direction trending with the #SuperBowl? Shouldn't their kiddy fans be in bed for primary school in the morning?

#SurroundSound UP on #Superbowl commercialsback down during game.

Shameless plug alert: Naughty by Nature's remake of OPP to promote JPP #SUPERBOWL

Who's down with.who? What was just played w/Naughty by Nature's O.P.P beat?  #Superbowl

i really hope madonna isnt horrible today at the #superbowl but i know its worthless to hope that #mygodmygodwhyhaveyouforsakenme

Trying to understand #nfl #superbowl at the minute, lots of numbers and stoppages. Determined to understand by the end of the game!

FUCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKK the #superbowl, oh yeah I said it :D

The Stadium reminds me too much of Earls Court tube station. Me no like #superbowl

#whatworks: cheaper #SuperBowl ads when you team up.

Dog eating Fluffy the cat then bribing owner to silence w/ a bag of Doritos is best #SuperBowl commercial so far.

Yo these #superbowl commercials have been lame as fuugghh!!

It was alright, did you see the M&Ms #SuperBowl commercial? That was funny!

Who would have thought 3 years ago GM would be around to even have #SuperBowl commercials. Mitt didn't think so.

John Carter aka JC. Disney's spin on Jesus. #GoPats #NFL #SuperBowl

Boring when nothing's happening, boring when something happens and they go straight to adverts. #superbowl

Harley owners are you on? HarleySpace is here  #harleydavidson #motorcycle #superbowl RT

Follow my friend for live tweets during #SB46 A little South Buffalo perspective on the game and life #superbowl #buffalobills

Giants are not letting Brady get comfortable. Patriots resorting to field goal. #Superbowl

Well this is shit! shows 3 guys talking, back to about 30s of football then talking again! Just play the game!!! #SuperBowl #

If you squint your eyes, it sort of looks like the #Bills are playing. #superbowl

Apparently the only #SuperBowl ad we're getting in Canada is the Hyundai/Sasquatch ad.. #ThanksCRTC #Not

#SuperBowl Doritos commercial very strong. I didnt see nuthin.

I never see the #SuperBowl being sponsored by #Tums or #PeptoBismol. I need a double dose of both right now.

Dear tax company I will not named: you are preemptively fired, forever and ever. #superbowl

You might be concerned about my #superbowl silence. Don't worry. I'm on the phone with my mom. #REALamerican

RT Only fair that if we have to watch Madonna at #Superbowl #halftime there should be a 5min #mma fight 1hr in2 romantic comedies. #nfl #ufc

giants and patiriots DUH!  goooo giiants!! #superbowl

I'm surprised they'd put a march movie in a #SuperBowl commercial.  #Disney #JohnCarter

I eat so much during the #Superbowl but when we are #losing its 10x worse. #ohmygosh #stuffed come on boysss

Brady has his manhood robbed by field goal. #superbowl

Paying taxes is like the government pissing in your pool. #superbowl #adbowl

Best commercials of the first quarter: best buy and Chevrolet #brandbowl #superbowl

I couldn't give two shits about the #SuperBowl

Let's go Giants, time to win the #superbowl again!!!!

GE makes the power that makes Budweiser? Maybe I'll start ignoring science like Creationists. #SuperBowl

So far I got the cheetah, M&M and Melanie Amaro commercial as best so far #superbowl

Just a warning to anyone who hasn't heard it yet, Madonna's new single is HORRIBLE. #superbowl

The M&M commercial was the best hands down. the funny commercials are the best! #superbowl

ELI MANNING YOU'RE A BASTARD AND I HATE YOU! #SuperBowl

Doing taxes is like pissing in the pool? And making Sister swim in it?  #Superbowl #commercials

Patriots have not started too well #SuperBowl

That ad was sad. Imagine how shitty your life would have to be to get that excited over the return of Budweiser #makeitplatinum #SuperBowl

People go crazy about the #superbowl like it's a holiday smh

Cue a massive rush to the bathroom at every bar in the US #Superbowl #superbowlcommercial

Because desperation fetishists need do their taxes too, apparently. #SuperBowl

Help me ask o!! Naija pple can lky to form. When did we start watching #superbowl

I only get the canadian feed of the #SuperBowl, so I only get canadian commercials

TaxACT: LOL Best of show so far. #brandbowl #Superbowl

So Budweiser is actually GE's bitch? Meh. Not very shocking actually.  #Superbowl

the two best things about the #SuperBowl is the snacks and the hularious commercials

And yet #ge doesn't pay any taxes, so not impressed with their so called contributions to America. End corporate welfare #SuperBowl

13 mins and 41 seconds til madonna serves u lil girls! #superbowl

The Saints aren't playin so im not watching the #SuperBowl

Half the people on my timeline do a better commentating job than the the ones on television. #SuperBowl

Glad I don't have work on Monday mornings! I get to watch #SuperBowl! Aww yeah!

#superbowl Really hope someone tackles Madonna off the stage during halftime.  Get someone half decent on

My TL has gone #SuperBowl cray cray! just goes to show how many Americans I follow on here.. Sorry but most Brits bore the fuck outta me -_-

So Madonna is coming on as a sub for the second half, yeah? #superbowl

Making the big game more interesting: Prop bets! #superbowl

Wonder if there has ever been a boy peeing in a pool #superbowl commercial before today? #brandbowl

What? Peeing in the pool is like getting your taxes done for free? #brandbowl #superbowl

It's so weird seeing the skyline I grew up with on the screen for the SuperBowl. #sb46

#Jacobs is really laying the wood right now. #superbowl

I'm kinda sick of Bud commercials now. #superbowl #SuperBowlcommercial

So far, not very impressed with the #superbowl commercials.

watched 10 mins of the #superbowl i still think its the worst sport around since they do fuck all for 90% of the match.why so many breaks?!!

At the end of the 1st, Giants lead 9-0. Our live coverage:  #SuperBowl #SB46 #NYG

Milwaukee's own Independent Studios did the Tax Act spot. nice job. #adworkers #superbowl Congrats!

The  New England Patriots vs London Silly Nannys was a well better game #superbowl

Easy 3! Just need a couple more! #SuperBowl

All thw police watching the #Superbowl. Lol

My God what a path for Bradshaw. That was almost like Moses came down and forced the New England defense to let him through. #SuperBowl

Someone tell New England's defense that the game has begun. #superbowl

Someone's down injured. For them to be down injured, I reckon his lung must have come out his arse or something. #Superbowl

Giants are killing the patriots. :( c'mon Tom Brady!!!!! #SuperBowl

#Superbowl 30 second ads fees are 3.2 million dollars today? When I first came to the US they were less than 1 million. .

You know you are following a lot of Americans when your Twitter timeline is filled with #SuperBowl tweets.

There is a football game being played in between all these commercials, right? Right? #SuperBowl

It's amazing how they can drag a 60 min game on for 4 hours #Superbowl #NFL

#bbcsuperbowl shoutout to the crew at the #HardRockCafe Edinburgh staying up until ungodly hours showing the #SUPERBOWL

Was that really the VW commercial in response to last years? :/ hoping for another one #SuperBowl

The horrible pairing in this #SuperBowl is only exacerbated by Chris Collinsworth's voice.

Ok VW the dog and the Star Wars were cute, but didn't feel cohesive enough #SuperBowl

The VW #Superbowl ad is the best so far, hands down.

I dont know bout you guys but im looking foward to the commercials. #Superbowl

VW - spoofing a past #SuperBowl commercial - cute, but I won't remember it in the morning.

Would love football (soccer) to adopt stopped clock for injuries like NFL does. Fans would get more value for money. #superbowl #soccer

Omg I love Steven Tyler #SuperBowl

Star Wars segment killed an otherwise cute and memorable ad #Superbowl

Hey this #superbowl shizzle ain't no bizzle. What the wizzle is goin on? A to the k homeboy, I need some o momma's chicken

I'm betting all my money on #SuperBowl commercials featuring doggies. How do I call one of those bookie things?

VW Star Wars commercial. I like you. #superbowl

Great turn out this aft. Thanks for hating football so much! #superbowl #gogiants

Watching a commercial of a dog working out is more fun to watch when scarfing your face with wings and chips. #fatty #Superbowl

did VW just Inceptionize their commercial? #SuperBowl

#Superbowl The aggressive play by the Giants on the ground is eating up the clock

trailer for Disney's John Carter movie and notice that they may have taken a scene from the #StarWars attack of the clones movie. #superbowl

Kraft chose to enjoy the #SuperBowl with Stephen Tyler? Either a huge idol fan or a huge Aerosmith fan huh? Which is more telling?

#superbowl commercial showing the new VW bug was great. Car looks great too bad I'll never buy another one of those cute lemons in my life

#superbowl has my dog in a tizzy. hope she poops in my moms house. :)

About to sit under the hair dryer and watch the game & do some HW .. this should be fun, LOL 3 #SuperBowl #Giants

Studying and watching the #Superbowl isn't quite working for me :-/

Nicks has glue on his hands. #SuperBowl

I loved that dog commercial(: it worked its but off to chase that car!! #SuperBowl

Whoot whoot it landed on heads which means I get that free pizza and 2liter drink #papajohns #superbowl

Darth Vader makes his #superbowl debut.

Fuckin' pats or fuckin' giants??? I'm conflicted. #superbowl

as didnt need star wars tie in. #brandbowl #superbowl

I do not think there should be any commercial repeats. #SuperBowl

There's no way Howard Stern will be as good anywhere as he is on his radio show. #superbowl #brandbowl

Loved the Darth Vader commercial :) yay for Star Wars! #SuperBowl

Okay, I genuinely do not understand American Football. I thought if I tried to pay attention I wouldbut no. #Superbowl

This is why I don't go to #SuperBowl parties .. I hate it when everyone sees me cry #Patriots #Giants #SB46

Nap during the half time show? #hatemadonna #needsleep #SuperBowl

coming through again with the awesome #SuperBowl commercials.

#VW and Chubby Dog ad was cute. Love the surprise #StarWars ending. #SuperBowl Ads

Animation is perfect for Dr. Suess, yet somehow no one has taken advantage of it yet. #SuperBowl

woah, if i was a football player i would be terrified of getting tackled by # 75 of the patriots #superbowl

Doritos can sell them products! smh #Superbowl

Now if they had a linebacker just randomly appear & crack #Madonna with a big hit, I can see the connection between her & the #superbowl

So calm from Manning - and what a catch as well. #Superbowl

I cant believe I',m watching the #SuperBowl game and I live in Australia!!!!!!

I'd like to see Eli smile sometime after he makes an awesome play. #SuperBowl #Giants

Predict the correct final score & winning team of the 2012 #SuperBowl & win a KampusBully T-Shirt

Sorry Darth Vader, the dog was better. #Superbowl

welll looks like me and are the only dedicated boozehounds #superbowl #chalkitup

I'm finding alternative comments on the #superbowl pretty funny :-) #hotpocketlockdown

VW, Doritos lead the pack so far with their commercials #brandbowl #SuperBowl

I love watching the commercial bowl with the football spots between it! #SuperBowl

i hate madonna so much i'm not even watching the half-time, even if LMFAO is playing. screw that old bag. #superbowl

have fun. The #superbowl is always worth watching. :D

So does Madonna think its a  smart move giving the #SuperBowl audience a free look at why her tour isn't worth the $300 tix she's asking?

#PinnerJFC manager Vib Harris shows his colours #Superbowl

Patrick Chung has been all over the place the 1st half #Patriots #SuperBowl

GNx  Giant will win #superbowl GO giants!!!!!!!!

#Superbowl is falling off! HBCU Marching Bands should do the halftime show! So much more entertainment!

The two old white men commentating the #SuperBowl  look like the two old muppets that sit in the balcony

The 2nd quarter too then It's just too intriguing right now #superbowl

Me now: play on iPod for 10 minutes, do homework for 5 seconds, look up at tv 2 seconds for good commercials, and then repeat #SuperBowl

I guess Spout trumps #Superbowl according to Olivia.

Sorry all I post is food. #superbowl lol

#superbowl? to bad i dont care :P

I'm for the Giants because they have better cameltoes. #superbowl

#1DToPlayAtTheSuperbowl You are all idiots. Those 5 wee poofs would get eaten alive at the #SuperBowl #Chinowankers

I'm cheering for Madonna, she's gonna win #SuperBowl

VW #Superbowl commercial a riff from Cantina scene in Star Wars I=IV.

Women watching Superbowl makes them that much hotter #superbowl

It's Victor Cruz vs. my brie wheel #Superbowl

Until the Lions make it to the Super Bowl, I will never care who wins #superbowl #detroitlions

Who needs to watch the #Superbowl when there's twitter to tell you all about it?

So far so gud #superbowl giants!! :D

Literally clueless. What the flying ken is going on? #Superbowl

I really need the #Bengals in the #superbowl next year

Giants Baby ! Tellme who you are Going for ? #SuperBowl #NYGiants 3

This game is pretty boring right now #SuperBowl

Hope we will see this again in a couple hours #patriots #superbowl #

So like I'm in between rereading catching fire, watching a movie and deep conditioning. #superbowl

what the heck is an illegal huddle? Did the Giants make a square instead of circling up? #superbowl

So Eli & I graduated HS in the same year! I wonder if he ever thought I'd be teaching at this point in my life? #questions #superbowl

Twitter blowing up right now #superbowl

Throw it! Catch it! really knows her football #superbowl

OK Folks We Made It..Delayed But Not Denied.Time For The Patriots To Turn This Thing Around #superbowl

Football is like UFC without the excitement.  #superbowl

Based on the women in their commercials, it should really be called Go Daddy Issues. #superbowl

Twitter is going mental about the #superbowl I'm staying off this till tomorrow so I don't have to read anything about it! Couldn't care!

if us Canadians had to watch the US commercials how would we ever know when the Junos are on? #superbowl #Junosblow

I wish people would pay attention to #Jesus as they do to the #superbowl.

Impressive #Madonna is performing after all these years. You can hardly notice she wears her traffic-cone bra down to her knees. #SuperBowl

As long as the Giants don't win I'm good. #Superbowl

BB right in the officials ear with that penalty, nice to see some focus from a Patriot #superbowl

I Decided To Watch The Game & I'm Going 4 The Giants!!! #SuperBowl

Can't wait till #eSports has a version of a #Superbowl

Very dissappointed inn dem #Patriots att daa #SuperBowl .. C'mon now !

Enjoying the game up top I see #superbowl

What is this thing called the #SuperBowl ? What makes one bowl better than the others? #CerealBowlEquality

Made a bet that pats will get a sack this drive. Have to root for a sack or for the giants to keep the drive going. #SuperBowl

#Patriots Defense takes too long to do EVERYTHING #SuperBowl

Illegal huddle? Man these refs are digging deep in the necronomicon. #SuperBowl

RT I really just want to watch commercials #superbowl

#Patriots . Pass football Catch football  Run Patriots run Look for goal post. Geeze. Go #Patriots #SB46 #SuperBowl

What the hell they feeding #64? Ain't gonna call him a fatty, not to his face anyway #Superbowl

All of y'all currently at #SuperBowl parties & reading this tweet, I hope you're cleaning up after yourselves.

#wtf LOL I think I get it a bit now aha. It looks dangerous :) + what's #superbowl then?

Why is it still necessary to use roman numerals for the #SuperBowl? The letters will eventually get out of control.

why does the #superbowl have to be on when I've got college in the morning -.- can't stay up any longer too tired..

#superbowl=commercials, commentators talking, throw ball, commercials, half time song, commercials. Give me proper English football anyday!

I love how they save the best commercials for the #SuperBowl

Good adviceDo your job, don't do anyone else's  #superbowl  (i love you Al Michaels)

Remind me again how #Madonna was chosen for the #SuperBowl.

Is it weird I noticed how the #Patriots uniforms compliment the #Giants uniforms. I'm a sucker for color coordination. #SuperBowl #SuperBert

We could cue up an LSU/Alabama game if you'd rather watch that! #SuperBowl

I'm just not into grid iron. People say cricket is boring but at least it flows. This us too much stop start! #SuperBowl

If they cant get HD right for the #SuperBowl how are they going to do with 3D for the Olympics?

my nigga I'm faded faded fadeddd #SuperBowl

My aunt has already has half a bottle of Pinot Grigio #slowdownbud #superbowl

The Giants are playing like they've been told that whoever wins gets to beat up Justin Bieber. #Motivation #Superbowl #BelieberBeaters

Les Miles sees nothing wrong with this MT Interesting strategy by the Patriots to not prepare at all for this game. #SuperBowl

This #superbowl is a mess! They making high school mistakes!

Watching a bunch of buff men in tights run around with some tea. Quite fun though. #SuperBowl

This #SuperBowl stuff is exciting. 1st time watching American Football and I like it!

Super Bowl beverage of choice: Extra spicy Caesar, mmm mm goood!  Go Giants #superbowl

Watching the #Superbowl No idea wtfs happening haha

What ever happened to good old BRITISH RUGBY? Bare #superbowl yank begs. Allow your lifes and watch a real sport that don't require padding

Even tho the #SuperBowl is pretty big and pretty intense, it will never compare with the #WorldCup. Soccerfootball.

Watching the #superbowl with my family! Good times. Who else is?? RT if you are

Man it sucks we don't get the American commercials in Canada #Superbowl

'You missed it.  You missed it, nigga.  You missed it' #SamQuotes #Superbowl

John Carter movie looks good. Can't wait to see it. #SuperBowl #Commericial

I am not a Giants fan. I'm an Eagles fan but they didn't make it to the #SuperBowl. Go Giants!

VW ad is the best so far, and it would be so even without the Vader appearance. #SuperBowl

Why do they not arrest players for illegal huddles? #cops #superbowl #crossoverpotential

That David Beckham ad is like watching myself. So weird. It's like we're twins. #SuperBowl #fb

#beckhamforhm Ummm I think I just died & went to heaven. #SuperBowl

Watching #superbowl, hoping that the Patriots win and that I don't have to go school tomorrow!

As a marketer, I'm never a fan of the #SuperBowl ads. But so far this year, they are paticularly underwhelming.

Methinks this Beckham commercial is not speaking to the masses. #SuperBowl

Clearly didn't think this #superbowl get together well. Need more snacks. Quick run to sheetz ha. (with Megan)

Not getting #superbowl commercials but just saw the new H&M David Beckham ad.ooooshya (:

David Beckham for H&M underwear ad is even better in HD #SuperBowl

#Superbowl H&M just had an add for homosexuals

#superbowl How can you send out 12 players by mistake?

average game and good commercials so far!! #superbowl #m&m's #doritos #budlight #davidbeckham

#Superbowl how's this score board from my friends daughter

If you follow me you already know I'm #TeamCowboys but I'm from NY so I'm #TeamGiants tonight. Good luck to both teams though #SUPERBOWL

'I might be gay but I ain't this.' -Tennessee Williams/me #GaySportBar #Superbowl

this nigga got a lower back tattoo #suspect #SUPERBOWL

Only time of the year I don't mind commercials #superbowl #toofunny

Never thought it would be this easy to focus on case analysis the #SuperBowl is easy to keep on mute with no horse in the race.

I'm so glad all these #SuperBowl commercials have #hashtags.

you looked amazing. Watch the #superbowl to make you more tired :)

Can't really watch the Super Bowl right now. Too much to do. #SuperBowl.

And all the polar bears crash through the thinning ice. #SuperBowl

Those polar bears look better than the Pats. #superbowl #brutal

Think I might actually understand American football #nochance #SuperBowl

Awwwwwwww coca cola polar bears are too adorable 3 #superbowl

LMFAO he just beat they ass for that ONE bottle of coke -.- #SuperBowl

The H&M ad didn't need anything big. Just Beckham in his undies and das IT!!  #SuperBowl

Who says women don't watch the #SuperBowl? That commercial was entirely for the ladies #Beckham

Can't stand the people hating on the #SUPERBOWL just cuz u don't understand the game or can't play stop hating no one give a fuck

Some might say that #beckhamforhm is the best commercial of the #superbowl, or ever. ;)

The  #Pats are losing because they cut someone the day before the  #Superbowl  #karma

Anyway, patriots to win #superbowl okay good thanks

I don't know what woman would say that the best #SuperBowl add was NOT #Beckham in his new underwear line. No disrepect to

I don't like these #cocacola commercials at all.  #superbowl

Polar bears can skate better than that. #superbowl

This #SuperBowl Game is Dull. I think imma twirl my #KappaKane! #Brazil2014 #SaoPaolo

Lmfbo! Touch down for the polar bear w/ the coke #Superbowl

That's ok, you can catch up with the commercials during the game! #SuperBowl

Too Many Fitties With Tattoos #SuperBowl Overwhelming

#Beckhamforhm = favorite #superbowl commercial by far!! What can possibly top that?! haha

Ok I'm straight. Did anyone else just see that David Beckham ad? #ffs #SuperBowl #ads

#davidbeckham for #h&m best commercial yet! Well visually speaking #Superbowl

Marketing mens underwear during the #SuperBowl is a terrible decision.

Polar bears playing football with a Coke bottle is better than the real game! #superbowl

I think I need to go look for an H&M immediately. Fingers crossed they have a cut out of David Beckham. #superbowl

More breaks than a kitkat factory. #superbowl

#Superbowl - go patriots whoo hooo x

Beckham ad-Totally for the women viewers #SuperBowl

Watching cartoon polar bears totally makes me want to drink a beverage that gives me diabetes!  #Superbowl

Favorite #commercial so far #H&M w/ #DavidBeckham hoo-aaah!!! #SuperBowl ok the VW one too :)

Hope all the hipsters enjoyed that Foster the People song on that bump out to commercial. #SuperBowl #EvenHipstersC

At least the scene-setting Indy shots will remind me fondly of the #Jets in Week 16 of 2009 with Dad and #SuperBowl

What is #SuperBowl? Idk if it is a game. But wait, game? How to play?:/ sorry i'm Indonesian, so i never play this game. Te

Nephew Obama did not invite me to his #superbowl party.  I guess he is afraid I will get really drunk & make a scene.  Drinking now, go Pats

Coca cola bears look more CG And worse. Should have been drawn. #SuperBowl

This NFL announcer sounds like Hawkeye. If the other one sounded like BJ, I'd be way more into this. #SuperBowl

Illegal Huddle? Didn't know there was such a thing. #SuperBowl

Top commercial hands down H&M with David Beckham.  #superbowl #notfair

Thank you for that #davidbeckham ad. An ad for all the ladies watching #superbowl

90% of the people watching the #SuperBowl are Boys and they show a dude in underwear !! Smdh

Those Polar Bears Coke commercials would be much cuter if there was still ice at the top of the world #global warming #superbowl

If you were playing there'd be few more points on the board. #superbowl

There are a lot of brodudes awkwardly commenting to each other on David Beckham's arched torso right now. #SuperbOwl

I give this game a big QUACK! so far. #superbowl booooooring!

I can't believe they showed David Beckham's tighty whities while I was in the kitchen!! Should have gone during the game. #superbowl

Anyone notice how all the Patriot rings were upside down there? #SuperBowl

coca-cola has had da best #SuperBowl commercial soo far ..

Is David Beckham selling web domains? #BrandBowl #superbowl

The older rings are sooo much nicer. the newer ones are way too pretentious #superbowl

Super Bowl commercials have been horrible so far. They should have accepted my ad for the KKK. #SuperBowl

Thank you, #DavidBeckham. Now I can put my pants on again. #SuperBowl

According to these Coke commercials, Polar Bears are endangered because they're idiots. #SuperBowl

Just saw the David Beckham's  commercial My life is complete! #beckhamforhm #SuperBowl

I'm loving these polar bear coca cola commercials! #superbowl

David Beckham's H&M commercial is def my fave so far #sohot #superbowl

Did you know that Ford asked Chevy not to air that apocalyptic end of world ad?  Seriously?  #superbowl

The only thing gayer than that David Beckham in his underwear ad is EVERY OTHER AD they've shown. #SuperBowl SuperBowlAds

Worst  #superbowl commercial so far?  #beckhamforhm, no thanks.

I never really pay the #SuperBowl no attention but I'm trying this year. So far so good

Anyone seethe Super Bowl ring commercial? 2 of the Pats rings were upside down. #PatriotsDisrespect #Superbowl

da best part abot da #SuperBowl is the commercials!

U go girl! Did u really go to that party? #SuperBowl

Awesome that Twitter is flush with everyone bitching about the commercials, very little on the game. #Superbowl

Travis Beckum may have torn his ACL but David Beckham sure looked good in that commercial. #SuperBowl

David Beckham naked in H&M spot. Hmm. Conflicted. Objectification is wrong, but um.. hello, hot? Hot. #SuperBowl #fb

Madonna would do a better job than brady with the way he is playin! #superbowl

#superbowl the american pundits on the B.B.C are pissed off with the presenter who is clueless about this sport. th

i tried to watch a #superbowl once. at the time, i would've related my attention span to that of a gold fish. nbanhlnfl

Am I the only one who doesn't really care who wins? #superbowl

Uh oh guys, I think I overestimated our pigs in blankets needs. There's *alot* of pigs in blankets here. help. #superbowl

Hey everyone, let me know who wins the game.  I'm heading to the mall to buy some David Beckham underwear.  #superbowl

Other thoughts running through my head: #DavidBeckham has a lot of tattoos #SuperBowl

I'm ready for some real commercials. Come on #SuperBowl

Now this i can watch #Superbowl it just reminds me of watchin the #thegame :p

The only thing I really like about the #SuperBowl are the commercials and tweets/coverage. #IEatOut

Why yes, I am wearing my Jerome Bettis Super Bowl jersey to watch the #SuperBowl.

HANDS DOWN to the Coca-Cola ad series with the polar bears Awesome! #superbowl #ads #brandbowl

So far my favorite commercial from the #superbowl is the Doritos commercial

Ficks sake Brady pull it together! #superbowl

ordering some wings with while we watch the #superbowl. yumm.

So Coke has spent $7 million so far on those two polar bear ads? Yikes. #brandbowl #superbowl

Can't go wrong with David Beckham & most of his clothes off during the #Superbowl. Nope.

Love the #superbowl but compared to the English rugby lads they all look like health and safety mad midgets.

The Beckham H&M commercial surely woke up all the bored girlfriends and wives.  #superbowl #brandbowl

is all mine.where did everyone go? #Superbowl o yeahhhh let me get to partying with all the cool people

That was NEVER going to get through. Only the PENITENT man shall pass. THE PENITENT. #superbowl

A few votes for Audi's commercial, but M&Ms was the winner by a landslide!  Love it or hate it? #brandbowl #superbowl

Nothing reminds me to pay my taxes like peeing in a pool. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlCommercials

After all that spinning and tossing, doesn't that polar bear know that his bottle is now going to spray EVERYWHERE?  #SuperBowl

I wish I had a polar bear that could get me bottles of Coke #Superbowl

Watching the super bowl with my family #superbowl

I will be totally happy if every commercial from here on out is of David Beckham. #SuperBowl

David Beckham does briefs now . Nice! #SuperBowlads #SuperBowl

Nothing good has ever come from the south florida bulls not even jpp #SuperBowl

Breaking news: My GMA thinks the H&M commercial was dumb. Therefore it just is. #brandbowl #SuperBowl

Judging from those Chinese symbol tattoos he has, David Beckham should've been selling Monster. #SuperBowl

Not even the #SuperBowl can interrupt my hour long shower lol

#davidbeckham looks like Amy Winehouse and Dirty Harry had a love child #superbowl

All the tv's in my house have the #superbowl on :L

Shut Up Chris Collins!!! #superbowl tweet

Random: is kinda cute now back to this #superbowl

I have to say I'm pretty excited to see Madonna perform. She's a true 80s Diva and I'm sure she's got some tricks up her sleeve. #Superbowl

Watching my first #Superbowl have no idea what's going on. But enjoying it

Beckham for Pres RT Ok #DavidBeckham wins the #SuperBowl & the World Series, Olympics, US Open, World

It's kinda pointless to tweet about the #SuperBowl because I'm pretty sure everyone and their mom is watching it.

I agree GTS all day long!#superbowl

#SuperBowl has the best commercials #handsdown  BTW let's go  #PATRIOTS

Here's a #SuperBowl commercial I paid $3 million less than the other guys for: Introducing the arrival of my new site

The only reason I would watch the #Superbowl would be for the #AwesomeCommercials & for the half time performance #MadonnaSuperbowl

Although I guess the OTT commercialism dripping with patriotism is what makes the #superbowl

This game right here!! *sits on edge of couch* #SuperBowl

Not a clue whats going on but im actually quite enjoying it LOL #Superbowl

That's rough to tear your ACL in the #SuperBowl but not as rough as your tactless team releasing you the day before.

Really who has steak at their #SuperBowl party???? We do that's who!!!!!

Good perspective, is focusing on the tech side of the #superbowl but also sports reports!  rt

I am loving your critiques of the #SuperBowl ads!

I could care less about the #Superbowl. After college ball, it's all about the money, not the team. #justsayin

Drinking tea and eating a slice of cake while watching the #Superbowl. I feel so English

I vote that David Beckham should appear in every #SuperBowl commercial. =D

Too much red white blue #superbowl

#SuperBowl time!!! I can't wait to see the half time ent. Wish I was celebrating in the USA with all my American friends! #partyup gang!

Come on & lets see a femShep Mass Effect 3 commercial!! #superbowl

Pretty safe to say Beckmen is done for the season, only about 37 minutes left in it #Superbowl

The Giants are just dominating the ball. The Pats have barely had the ball. #superbowl

Notice how most Super Bowl commercials display a hastag. This is the Super Bowl of the hashtag #superbowl #Latism

My tv is not even on the #superbowl, just waiting for #MadonnaSuperbowl

hello David beckham. Best part of the #superbowl so far .

If the Giants get the run game going, the Pats are going to be in a world of shit. #SuperBowl

I think the only way the giants would be playing better is if they had Rick Moranis as their coach #superbowl #littlegiants

Google TV should have a feature where it explains what's happening in sports games to non-sports people/film majors. #SuperBowl

Too many tattoos. #icky  David Beckham's underwear ad just made me think of hepatitis. #Superbowl #ads

Apparently watching the Superbowl has emboldened my 2 oldest boys to tackle me. 1 of the boys (who will remain nameless) bit me. #superbowl

Torn ACL. Nfl aint a game! He's out 6 months+ #superbowl

Where are you watching the game? #superbowl #SB46 hope you don't lose your 500 bucks :)

Can't wait for the half time #superbowl commercials. For now the Chevrolet one is my favorite.

I hope they make enough runs,  go teams go! #superbowl  #idontknowsports #isitcricketagain?

Non factor #Superbowl oh and double team !

1 of the players has torn his ACL from a shoulder barge, our England rugby team must piss themselves with laughter watching this #SuperBowl

Too bad the #SuperBowl means absolutely nothing to me.

not a clue what's going on but it's good to watch #superbowl

#giants have to score this drive to have the ball this much and it only be a one possession game is not good #superbowl

-______- we need another touch dwn this the #superbowl!

Grrrr didn't they look scary in there pictures! #Superbowl

Good luck to your other NY team, sir. #superbowl

haha. Neither of these teams deserved to be in the #Superbowl anyway. Both got incredibly lucky with opposing screw ups.

Was watching the Super Bowl with the kids I look after at their fathers place. But 1 is sick so he had to leave. Go Giants #SuperBowl

I'm not going to lie.I'm only watching this for the half time show. #SuperBowl

So far, Chevy owns the commercials with the 'end of days' spot. #chevrolet #brandbowl #superbowl

C'mon Brady!!! Let's do this! Let's go PATS!!! #NewEnglandPatriots #SuperBowl

#Superbowl Sunday is the day all nerds unite to all at once feel like we're missing out on something we don't care about.

#Superbowl is when you do everything during the game so you won't miss the commercials.

Wonder how any hot wings are sold #SuperBowl Sunday.

My beautiful niece fell asleep on me while watching #SuperBowl

Zoey heard say 'Go Giants' the other day so that's who she is rooting for too. She loves Ellen!! #SuperBowl

Stating that you're not interested in the #superbowl is a good way to alienate yourself from 84% of the population.

Game, what game? Oh, the break between commercials? #superbowl

I still love despite his creepy mustache. #Superbowl #GoPats

Photo: Today is the one day I look forward to not fast forwarding my #DVR. #Superbowl commercials #ftw!! Go

I thought we'd have seen a few more deep passes by Manning like the one just missed by Manningham. #superbowl

#SuperBowl .. One for the #Refs they never disappoint with bad calls to help the #Pats

Huge holding call on the Giants! Penalty cost them a first down. Patriots take over on their own 3 yard line. #superbowl

I think I might be the only person not looking forward to the halftime show #SuperBowl

#StarWars in 3D? Isn't there an amusement park ride that already simulates that? Been there, done that. #SuperBowl #Commercials

Only four minutes to go in the half? Where has this game gone?! #SuperBowl

Football players jumping around and celebrating every 5 minutes, break for commercial, then repeat. Still dunno wats going on! #superbowl

Being Canadian and being able to watch only some of the amazing #SuperBowl ads

They should follow that Chevy Sonic ad with one for Chiropractors. #SuperBowl

People not faithful to their respected teams tend to be unfaithful to their girl/boyfriends #Superbowl #bandwagoners

We are watching the #SuperBowl!! So excited for the commercials!!

I swear #superbowl is way better in the states !

I have to agree with you on the Chevy Sonicit was a Wow maker #SuperBowl

OMG Tom Brady just reserved his chocolate covered strawberries! #superbowl

looking forward to half time power nap. fuck madonna #superbowl

The Half Time show coming up at half time. Thanks for that, would have thought it was at the end. #SuperBowl

I don't understand all the #Superbowl fuss. Nobody cares about it the rest of the year.

Why do men have two balls while the best games in the world are played with one ball only??? #puzzled #afcon #superbowl

Hey #Chevroletdoes this mean I can't skydive a Sonic? Come on, the website is letsdothis.com #brandbowl #superbowl

I am trying to watch the #Superbowl game but all I seem to be thinking about is David Beckham in his undies

Dear Canada, please stop censoring #SuperBowl ads. What's the point? I can see them all on YouTube anyway. #BigBrotherNoLongerInControl

these commercials are not really doin it..pick it up #superbowl

It's a sad day when cleaning your house & exfoliating your face overshadow the #SuperBowl

The #SuperBowl needs to start getting better halftime performers. I suggest GWAR!!!!!!!!!

Getting ready for half time.  What do you think Madonna will sing? #Superbowl

Turns out it was a bad idea to pick a bunch of football beginners for #SuperBowl  nobody seems to know the rules

Kinda feel like all this half time hype is because the show might not be that good!!!! #SuperBowl

Q3: I'm not really having #superbowl foods/snacks but I did have pizza for supper!  #Teampepsi #pepsivscoke

RT Turn off your scheduled tweets during big events like #SuperBowl. U look silly talking about other things right now  Amen! #in

The Patriots really need to step it up #SB46 #SuperBowl

Tom Brady has such a ping on him #superbowl

Cant wait to eat this cake made by #superbowl #instyle

This game is not too entertaining I must say #SuperBowl

someone needs to explain to me how Madonna has 7 grammys? I don't understand. And I want janet jackson back at half time! #superbowl

Logan mankins? Zoltan Mesko? Henry Hynoski? These people sound like Cosmonauts or X men or something.. #superbowl

You're an awesome person if you have or food at your #superbowl party. My one lady party does!

I only watch #SuperBowl for the new and sometimes funny commercials!!

The best Super Bowl ad thus far?  I vote for the Chevy truck Mayan apocalypse ad.  The Twinkies are a nice touch. #chevy  #SuperBowl

last year, was the first to use a hashtag in #Superbowl spot. It was #ProgressIs. :) Of course, I #WantAnR8.

Yes!! Tweet a pic from Sydney!! Wish you were here too! #SuperBowl

Dont see what all the fuss about the #superbowl is? Football is far more exciting to watch!

#kidrock should be the halftime sho performer for all #superbowl s for all time !

Loving the commercials and the game so far!! #Superbowl #GoGiants

Great catch by #Gronk for 20 yards.  Good to see. #SuperBowl

Patriots are going to go into half time with a lead.  #BoldPrediction #Superbowl

Umm how hot is David Beckham?!? #SuperBowl

Confession: I haven't been paying much attention to the actual game this whole time. #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Almost to the 2 minute warning. Right now millions of men are scrambling to find the remote before Madonna's halftime show starts

Chevy sonic commercial is pretty sweet. 'From your first time, to the time of your life' #SuperBowl #chevy

I bet is eagerly awaiting for Madonna to perform at the #superbowl. With notebook in hand.

Might be more action in #cupcakewars than the #superbowl. Refs doing what they can to keep the #pats in the game.

I think there can only be one heckler in a happy marriage - I am it #SuperBowl

#superbowl Go Giants, Brighton Cool & His Magic Scooter Loves the 9 - 3 score Giants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great. Not being in America watching the #SuperBowl, I am missing the #Avengers TV Spot. :'(

I hate to say it but the #superbowl is a bit of a snooze fest

Best part about the #SuperBowl so far? The #avengers trailer!

I don't see what's so great about them. #SuperBowl.

Check out all the #FriskyFriday #Babes who are celebrating the #SuperBowl  Shout out to &

Is the #superbowl just another irrelevant distraction? Or is it a meaningful ritual for American culture?

Has there ever been a black punter or kicker at the #superbowl ?

I need that dog in the Sketchers commericial immediately.  #Superbowl

I swear around #SuperBowl times u get the best adverts

Adriana Lima commercial was a HUGE hit with my group - and so true! #BrandBowl #Superbowl

What's been your favorite movie trailer during #SuperBowl ?

in function only. The #SuperBowl has far more pageantry than we could ever dream of.

40 million people plan to share their favourite ads online after the game ^ET #brandbowl #adbowl #SuperBowl

120 Pizza Rolls, 2 giant pots of Nacho cheese, 40 burgers, 50 hotdogs, 12 friends, and a 72 inch HD Flat screen #Superbowl

So far, Giants are playing a very 49ers-style game. Great defense, winning the field position battle, just enough offense. #SuperBowl

And comic nerds everywhere just stopped watching the #superbowl. #avengers #XLVI #SB46 #SB46ads

My point: Nard Shots-World Destruction-Cute Animals-Blue Colors #SuperBowl

@highlight

Superbowl Patriots vs Giants.

@highlight

Madonna will be a guest performer on the halftime show.

@highlight

They'll start building Madonna's stage in exactly 2 minutes

@highlight

That's rough to tear your ACL in the #SuperBowl but not as rough as your tactless team releasing you the day before.
