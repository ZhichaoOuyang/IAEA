Currently posting letters to Scottish MPs asking them not to vote on English only issues in Westminster #indyref

#Indyref is over! Just a great song for that - by contrast!   Sleep now!

Has Westminster written cheques for Scotland it cannot afford to cash? #indyref

Miliband's response to English votes on Engliah matters is dissemble, delay, distractLab desperate not to give proper democracy. #indyref

Yep, it's all about the Banks. #indyref

A UK that remains intact is a more secure  nation in the face of extreme politics on the continent. 2/3 #indyref

Statement by President Barroso on the results of the #Scottish referendum:  #IndyRef

Whereas YES Scotland was a democratic movement quarantined from England, maybe we'll set more than the heather on fire. #devomax #indyref

To settle the West Lothian question, the only possible answer is for England to secede from Great Britain. #indyref

Sons of Scotland. Mel Gibson died for your freedom. He'll be pleased you voted yes #IndyRef

A bit of #history trivia for my friends in the United Kingdom.   #indyref

Do you think there'd be this much coverage on if it had been a #yes I don't think so #indyref

Now the govt doesn't have #indyref to hide behind how about this getting sorted now  #CSAinquiryNOW

Video Evidence of Vote Rigging During Scottish Independence Count - Democratic Underground  #indyref #vinb

This~ vi 'Stop the Celebrations you Imperialist Pigdogs #indyref Scotland'

'Better Together' reach the magic 2 million; 'Yes Scotland' got 1.6 million votes. Emphatic win for 'NO' campaign #indyref #ScotlandDecides

Every reform legislated by the current UK #Coalition Govet has re-centralised power away from local government.#planning #housing #indyref

In the end, fear trumped pride. The dangers of independence motivated more than dreams of full nationhood #indyref

thing I learned from #indyref - for many Americans the word 'independence' makes them as excited as 'freedom' or 'justice' without context

United States was never offered a yes/no vote ,the English stormed our beaches with Guns,demanding we pay taxes or die  #indyref

Was so looking forward to opening up a new export market but sadly it won't be the case! #indyref

Our six #indyref winners and losers. Who were yours?  #c4news

I'd have thought the Scotland Independence Referendum was important enough to warrant international observers #indyref

So about to start post-#indyref press conference excluding Scottish #Holyrood political editors and handpicking reporters

Congratulations to the 73% of pensioners over 65 to 70 who have screwed over every 17-18 year olds chance for a free education. #indyref

I am proud to be one of the 45% of brave Scots that fought to give hope and a future without worry! #indyref

Alex #Salmond resigning? Gosh! Why now?I just don't get it.#IndyRef's first casualty. Surely not its last.

what better way to commemorate the #no victory in #indyref than watching this beauty?  cc:

No great fan of Salmond, but anyone who ranted and raved about him or voted No because of him/the SNP, you have your wish. #indyref

But still, he didn't have the power to sell anything else and what he did do was really good. #indyref was exactly what the Uk needed.

After the Scotland #indyref, the United Kingdom has to make some serious, fundamental changes.

Good for him! MT Newspapers not invited to resignation press conference: FT; Telegraph, Mail, Express #indyref

Polls closed counting done.. the winning speeches have been made the promises already broken! #indyref

That's another Scottish referendum done, looking forward to the next one in 15 years! #indyref

Video: BBC News - David Cameron sets out UK-wide changes 'to build better future'  #indyref

Video: BBC News - Alex Salmond to step down as Scotland's First Minister  #indyref

As a comparison: 2011 NI Assembly election, nationalists - SF/SDLP - got 41.4%: SF 30%. 45% of Scots just voted for independence. #indyref

So seeing she helped sell the idea to the Scots will now resign over Milliband's refusal to accept Brown's timetable? #indyref

Compare.  We will win this people.Hope over Fear. #IndyRef #VoteYes

You led a great campaign, and should be so proud!   #indyref

#indyref Anyone thought about the fact what PM offered wasnt the deal. Deal was just for Scots not 2 inc Eng!

The Queen parses the #indyref result. It almost seems She was reconciled to a Scotland in the Commonwealth

Tensions rising in Glasgow #indyref Police at the scene in George Square

And yes, I'm in Economy. Quite nice back here.  #indyref #Gatwick

Celebrities, politicians react to Scottish vote:  (Photo by Cathal McNaughton/Reuters) #indyref

Media now showing pictures of thugs in George Square never showed the joy  hope of the people supporting Yes  #indyref

The Union as we know it is dead, says Welsh First Minister - Belfast Newsletter  #indyref

RT  The last time the United States saw voter turnout as high as Scotland's today was in 1876. #indyref #ScotlandDecides

#IndyRef: It would be ironic if #England campaigns/votes for an English social democratic parliament.

#indyref one thing's for certain: This is not the end but the start of a new beginning for the #UK

very good, balanced  good natured on #indyref tonight. Esp Perth live ppl and the glamourous David Torrance :)

The obligatory 'don't mourn, organise' post for #indyref from Edinburgh AF is pretty good.

#Catalonia parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a law to hold their own #indyref

How we so nearly laughed at Mr Oliver.#indyref

#indyref stand down.the eyes of the world are back on kim kardishan's arse.

Scotland have been sold a pig in a poke #bbcaq #ukip #indyref

#indyref The good Prof was probably right on - he went on to take a 1st but in English. He, too, can write.

Is now the moment for the UK to consider becoming federal? #indyref #bbcaq

The photo started circulating just as the live feed went down. Blargh. I'm sorry to have contributed to misinformation. #indyref

least politically  probably for Union too. Indeed, while want Scots to stay, if don't keep word would be right to vote again. #IndyRef

change not just in Scotland, but whole of UK. Clear things can't continue as they are and need true devolution across nation. #IndyRef

Dramatic scenes in #Glasgow - police everywhere - flares being thrown #indyref  - the day hasn't finished with us yet

Indeed. But this is nothing new in Glasgow football circles, alas. Not just an #indyref issue.

Am sure votes cast done on best reasons and evidence, which people can disagree over; not afraid or anti anything, different views. #IndyRef

I voted Yes b/c I thought it was best, others voted No b/c they thought the same. Either way, don't be ashamed of your nationality. #indyref

Quebec separatists mocked relentlessly amid #Scotland vote #indyref  via

votes decided , please all just love each other #indyref I love the fact important questions raised without divorce

You 16-17 year olds; really did your country proud. 73% of you for Yes. Bodes well for the next stronger wave of campaigners.#indyref

Same as the #torylabour threatening promisesthey created chaos and division and rule with disorder #indyref

Scotlands shame!  #Nothanks I wonder what theyd have done if theyd lost! #indyref

It doesn't matter U feel they r not representative.  They are still #Unionists all the same. #GeorgeSquare #Indyref

#Glasgow: Nazi salutes from the #No side at #GeorgeSquare.#indyref #Scotlandvia

via Several examples of VOTE RIGGING on video. Did this happen in BC's election? Watch  watchout  #indyref

#Glasgow today: supporters and opponents of independence unite in condemning thuggish idiots. #indyref #scotlanddecides

wouldn't waste time with agenda driven journo's. Huff ran article yestdy suggesting #indyref Blair's fault

No so sure about this. Brown, and his impact on #indyref could well linger like Banquo's ghost whenever Miliband pops up.

Hope all the Celtic supporting #NoVoters will be out congratulating the #OrangeOrder for their support in the #IndyRef today.

I had my #indyref party friends around me yesterday, so I'm only really dealing with the reality now, bursting my #yes balloons
