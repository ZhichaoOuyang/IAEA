No chance of us winning the Euros, Hodgson's tactics will be too negative to make it far in the tournament. #Euro2012

Amazingly 1984 last hosts to win Euros - only 1 team even making the final #euro2012

Something tells me the Greek players may also be distracted by what else is happening in their country #Euro2012 #euro #economy

#Euro2012 First yellow card in euro Papastahopoulos Ex player

This is all part of the Greek economy drive. Their government have lumped on Greece to lose. Poland could actually save the Euro #Euro2012

I feel sorry for the Greeks on that one. Both decisions borderline yellows at harshest. Who sent the NBA refs to the Euros? #Euro2012

Poland in the lead and being a better team. During euro in Poland. Dreams do come true :)) #euro2012 #Poland

Idiot of a ref, just ruined a perfectly good game of football, won't enjoy the Euro's at this stage. #Euro2012

Poland kick-off with just 45 minutes separating them from their fist ever EUROs win, where ten-man Greece have it all to do
