I was re-watching Euro 2000. I never got over that Trezeguet goal #euro2012

It's ironic that #Euro2012 celebrates competitiveness while Euro 2002-2012 has destroyed it.

All of a sudden, Chelsea's win over Bayern is a model for the Euro teams 'trying' to get 3 points? Gimme a fucking break FFS! #Euro2012

Aiden McGeady in the Euro 2012 finals. Scotland playing games with no strikers. Fair to say he made the right choice  #euro2012 #fb

The quickest ever goal in the European Championship was from Russia's Dmitri Kirichenko (Russia 2-1 Greece) at Euro

Performance of the tournament for me so far just ahead of De Rossi and Arshavin. Great Euros so far! #Euro2012

Watching Ireland is a bit like watching Finland. Except for a fact that one can not watch Finland in the Euros. Never. #emfutis #euro2012

TR not just off-side, off-Euro(pe) #euro2012

I dont think a team has had a better chance than that it the euros so far #euro2012 #shocking

England never won their first Euro group stage match. Three draws and three loss so far. #Euro2012

Anyone has link to Euro babes? :p #Euro2012

Groans. Here we go. The English media will now claim England will win the Euros. Blah blah #euro2012

Same opponent, same stage, same type of goal, same spell of game and same resultant scoreline as Lampard v France in Euro 2004. #Euro2012

Great goal by Nasri. Here's to the Euro-hating and immigrant-bashing Sun-worshipers. #euro2012

Much prefer Euro Cup to World Cup. Greater depth of talent, every pool match feels like a quarter-final #Euro2012

#Euro2012 - 2 players (Lescott-Nasri) from same club (City) score in 1 Euro match for different countries (ENG-FRA).

Samir Nasri is 2nd to score vs his own club keeper at Euros. First was Gascoigne vs. Goram (Rangers) in 1996 #Euro2012 (v

#Euro2012 - Sweden have lost every single match against hosts at Euro or World Cup (4 out of 4) conceding almost 4 goals per match (15)

Love how its called the Euro's but the fans are doing a Mexican wave #EURO2012

The Euros show an Oriental bias, the more Easternly teams usually win  queue a Ukraine-Russia final, you heard it here first. #euro2012

I LOVE having a June birthday! ALWAYS during World Cup and Euro Cup! :D #UkraineVSweden #Euro2012

#Euro2012 If you support the Euro Cup you support the slaughter of stray dogs.

The last game of Matchday 1's contests at this Euro final certainly is making a case against Spain/Italy as best game so far #Euro2012

If Finland would make to the Euro's it would certainly face Greece,that would be the worst blue and white scrimmage ever.#emfutis #euro2012

Ukraine have won their first ever game at the Euros! :O #euro2012
