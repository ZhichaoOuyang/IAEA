#Brexit Douglas Carswell, Brexit, and the BoE's independence  #VoteToLeave

Are 5% of firms forcing EU rules on the rest? #EUref #Brexit

I'm certain Obama wouldn't have an EU Empire impose law  regulations on America. So why tell us how to vote #Brexit

Adam Shub of the #uk is our good partner but we like to see it stronger in Europe. #brexit #gmfytn

UK Citizens views are more important than banks  corporations.We'll decide on our EU membership not Obama!#Brexit

Obama Barack 'warned' by 5 Brexit MPs and who isn't an MP. Sheesh, he must be quaking in his boots. #Ukip #EUreferendum

lots of threats  1/2 truths everywhere. But I've decided to only read #Brexit (sensible) material for April. Being 'decided'

Because the many do not have a plan for #Brexit, and without a plan we lose. A plan removes fear, uncertainty, doubt

Views on the UK with regard to #brexit - veeery insightful facts and figures.

Too little.. Too Late! They opened the flood gated. Time to #Brexit

Don't forget to push home they need to register to vote #EUreferendum  #Brexit

Well #Brexit er Tory MP would apparently :

A list has to be made of the companies which favour #Brexit so that they earn business from their stance

#Cameron and #Merkel endorse this madman as 75 million Turks get set for visa free travel to the EU #Brexit

How PATHETIC is camoron, 2nite he is BEGGING the EU to allow him to take VAT off Tampons for f*cks sake just #Brexit then WE do what WE want

They might, we wouldn't #Brexit will cost us billions #EUreferendum #StrongerIn

Devil will B in the detail, wait 4 Cam 2 claim major victory telling UK the EU can B reformed, ooo mother #brexit

When we vote for #Brexit,just think, we can scrap all VAT!

I do not quite follow why is ruling ourselves controlling our borders and saving 8 billion a year such a bad idea #Brexit  #DailyMail

Paul Nuttall.  This is our time, our opportunity, to shape the rest of the Century. Time to GO #brexit

Responsibilities of EU Commissioner 'in charge' of migration.UnelectedUnaccountableUtter failure#Brexit

#Brexit is imperative - E.U. Woos Turkey for Refugee Help, Ignoring Rights Crackdown - The New York Times

says the Rothchild news org. Absolutely no vested interest in wanting Britan inside the plantation. #Brexit

Proof that we need to #brexit. UK has to make a deal with the #EU to choose what to tax!! #out

Cameron throwing his weight around in Europe, getting rid of the VAT on tampons. Merkel is shitting herself ffs #Brexit

Rupert Murdoch's calculation on backing #Brexit is: what if they lose and Tory govt and Labour hate me? Cameron won't forgive him. Tricky.

Seems Remainians all about economics but #brexit much wider issues are important to them.#brexit

Seriously? Cameron claiming he won flexibility from #EU to cancel #TamponTax? It's zero VAT in Ireland for tampons.Anti #Brexit propaganda!

Swiss People's Party Moves to Roll Out Burka Ban Nationwide  via #newsnight #Brexit #LeaveEU

Kurdish woman shot dead after rejecting arranged marriage in #Germany   #brexit

It seems Sport and Politics do mix, with Man Utd opting for an early #Brexit. #Manutdvliverpool #MANLIV

I respect those views -but even with #Brexit UK will still be following EU rules as part of unavoidable trade deal

With #Brexit looming, tweet an image of what the EU means to you with the hashtag #myimageoftheEU:

Maybe is right: they only listen when you wave goodbye. #Brexit

I have explained the phenomenon here You kippers think you need a piece of paper to trade?#brexit

Wonder if he'll mention the imposition, by the #EU, of 20% Vat on insulation materials in the UK? #GO #UKIP #Brexit

Perhaps should put an EU tax-free tampon up his backside. It might shut him up. #Brexit

tells Obama to stay at home and the USA cheers Nigel #Brexit

I cannot imagine #Cameron really supporting Turkey joining EU #Brexit

What's the EU ever done for all of us? The breath and depth is amazing! #euref #brexit #strongerin

The Eurovision Song Contest is a good analogy of how the EU works! It's a club of cliques and we don't get many votes. #Brexit

To vote #Brexit is NOT xenophobic or even anti-european. Its a vote for the core principles of democracy that those in power are accountable

Thank fuck Nicky Morgan is on the side of the #remain campaign #cluelessbitch #bbcqt #VoteLeave #Brexit

It's not Tory austerity, it's EU policy and started in Germany long before it reached our shores #Brexit #bbcqt

I bet a #brexit will be your best chance to get off the ever moving econ target hook.

Cameron and Osborne have screwed up big time with these cuts. Don't trust them now so why should we trust them on the EU? #bbcqt #Brexit #eu

Bitch fight between  is laughable. Like they're not on the SAME SIDE. Wake up people.#Brexit #LibLabCon

Stop sending money to Brussels and use some it to help our disabled #notoESAcuts #Brexit #bbcqt

Why is Labour's pro-EU campaign a secret? Where is it? Are Corbyn  McDonnell secret #Brexit supporters? #EUref

Sovereignty  via The #EUReferendum is a once only, forever, in perpetuity vote. #Brexit #bbcqt

Again - #Labour is NOT all in for the #EU - you have members of your own party wanting to leave!!!!! #bbcqt #EUreferendum #Brexit

#labour: British jobs for mass immigration workers! #grassrootsout #brexit for better! #ukreferendum #bbcqt

The choice is truth and hope in #Brexit or the certainty of lies and terror under the #EU #bbcqt

I can demonstrate I am right - you tell me where and why I am wrong or admit you can't justify #Brexit

My idea of #Brexit is to set off a workers movement that will turn Britain into a second #Scandinavia

Ermm, no. Not me. Nor anyone I've spoken to in last 6 weeks and that's a lot! #Brexit or Not? Who knows? #marketing
