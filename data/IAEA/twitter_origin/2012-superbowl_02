According to Nielsen Media Research, #SuperBowl ads are 58 percent more memorable than the average commercial.

Right Now On #SuperBowl Sunday Is Announcing That Our Brand New Website Will Be Launching On 2-14-2012 #Giveaways #SavageSin

Do #SuperBowl ads even work?! I can't imagine how they justify spending MILLIONS for 30 seconds of air time

second most disappointing part of NBC's SuperBowl coverage: Nick Cannon. #disappointed #SuperBowl

Indianapolis should have no problem hosting  #SuperBowl They have been practicing for 100 years hosting The 500?

#Superbowl = where the commercials are actually good, there's soooo much food, and you get to watch boys in tight pants. #perfection

Waiting for #AaronRodgers to do the discount double check during his analysis of the #SuperBowl

Nobody here wants to watch pregame show,becuz of all the excessive dick riding dun by the wack ass analyst #superbowl

As a neutral I'm torn, has just made my mind up. Patriots all the way. #Superbowl

Got the Patriots winning this one tonight, y'all. #SuperBowl

I'm more excited about the #Superbowl ads than the game. But still, Go #Giants.

Any team who takes out the from the #Superbowl deserves to win that years cup. #nygiants

If the #SuperBowl wraps up quickly, I may watch #Spartacus. Then my emasculation will be complete
