No #GE16 #leadersdebate in Irish due to lack of proficiency by certain candidates. #gaeligebhriste

He highlights all the false promises in the last general election, a dishonest way of buying votes.  #ge16 #leadersdebate

Irish politics in one clip. Vote FG/FF/Labour Out. #GE16 #leadersdebate #cblive

Britain.. How PR voting looks ( works?)Irish general election leaders' debate. Live  #GE16

Here's what Labour plans to do if re-elected  #ge16

Yes we back Irish businesses , well said Donnolly #GE16 . Would be different to have people in the Dail who know about business

I didn't expect abolishing the UFC to be such a key issue in this general election. Worrying times for Dana White #GE16

says we should back Irish businesses over multinationals #leadersdebate #ge16 #cblive

#vinb #GE16 #leadersdebate As Irish citizens, we inhabit a kleptocratic state and a political universe of distrust

My sis discovered Stephen Donnelly B4 last election. Told me he was great. She's right. If only they were all as smart. #GE16

#GE16 17.5% of all Irish born citizens now live abroad. Due to no jobs. Recovery? What recovery !!!#GETREAL

Well said #climatechange has been ignored in election discourse to date

Lucinda is very impressive always. One of Irish politics' great lost leaders. No wonder we spend so much time in the shit. #ge16 #cblive

Is Donald Trump running in the election too? At least he is honest even if he is a moron! #cblive #leadersdebate #ge16

I can see why Fine Gael hid Enda in run up to last election, Joan sinking fast #leadersdebate #GE16

Can we get Claire Byrne to start up a party and run in #GE16 Id vote for her! Taking no shite here! #leadersdebate

We have to be as ambitious for Irish Businesses says Stephen. Nail on head #GE16

#ge16 #cblive pay as much attention to irish indigenous industry as fdi

Irish politics at its absolute finest

I think there's a couple of leaders up there who are involved in one election campaign too far. #ge16 #leadersdebate #cblive Vision lacking.

I have never hoped that so many people would not be elected, as I do for so many in #GE16 #leadersdebate #cblive

#SocDems Proposing Irish National Health Services. We need network of community healthcare centres says #ge16

Interesting that three Irish party leaders, including Gerry Adams, argue for a British-style NHS. #GE16 #Leadersdebate

Who is most responsible for the absolute fucking disgrace of an Irish health service? #GE16 #leadersdebate #cblive

Get a daily Election 2016 #GE16 digest here:  #leadersdebate

No one has tackled the issue of building a big wall to keep the Mexicans out yet. Get Trump an Irish passport #ge16 #leadersdebate #cblive

#ge16 Moment of the election so far - Enda pointing at a page.It would be great if people got a proper cut on

A very white male audience. Not much recognition of the diversity in Irish society. Missed chance rte.  #GE16

Get  and other innovative irish organisations to debate in #leadersdebate #cblive #ge16

I'd say RBB and Lucinda could be the most explosive love affair in Irish political history. #rightmeetsleft #GE16 #cblive #leadersdebate

Avoiding the election day whatever: Apparently there was something on the telly tonight. Did anyone watch it? #GE16

He had me until that nonsense about creating a housing quango.. Fast track to Irish Water mark 2

Claire Byrne might be elected as Cathaorleach under the new secret TD ballot system the way this is going #leadersdebate #GE16

But he failed these people for 5 years and won't even think about them after election

Ireland's prisons are full, overcrowded  extremely costly to the Irish economy#GE16 #leadersdebate #cblive

Irish people have a cure for insomnia, its called Joan Burton and will be available on tv and doorsteps for the next few days #GE16

I wonder who id use my 3 strikes of murder on before I get locked up #GE16 #LeadersDebate

the government you lead, was not elected with a mandate from a general election. #GE16 #leadersdebate #cblive

Barrett and Donnelly have really shown up the main political parties this evening. Fresh voices to Irish politics #leadersdebate #GE16

Any chance Claire would like to go for election well done to her on keeping them all in line ! #leadersdebate #cblive #GE16

Reckon result #GE16 will lead to #GE16 2nd election.

. and re-elected, or a chaos coalition? A clear choice. #CBlive #LeadersDebate #GE16

No mention of #repealthe8th tonight. One of the biggest issues of this election  not a peep. #leadersdebate #cblive #GE16

I couldn't debate anyone in Irish, but you wouldn't catch me then trying to score points using Irish in a closing statement. #cblive #ge16

Why on earth wasn't #repealthe8th even mentioned?! It's come up LOADS in this election! #cblive #GE16

Id say the will get a fair few more votes after that, and rightly so! #ge16

Hard to see the political advantage in dressing like Cromwell for an Irish general election debate. #GE16

We do not believe charging for domestic water. Irish Water was set up for privatisation #vinb #GE16

So what will we call the 2nd General Election of 2016 after the hung Dail we're going to get after this one? #GE16 #cblive

Honestly dubious about voting in this election , not convinced by anyone #GE16
